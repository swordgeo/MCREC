This build seeks a way to grab the best of both play-Styles and combine it. I think the build works best, if you play together with a justice character, as you have to change to AE from time to time. But if you pop back to hero, you will devastate the enemy lines like a hurricane.\r\n\r\n**Preparation:**\r\nIt ist most important to get the Valkyrie-Upgrades out soon ([Aragorn](/card/25007), [Dragonfang](/card/25006) and [Valkyrie's Spear](/card/25005)).  Play [Combat Training](/card/01057) to improve your attack further. Also get out [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017), and start killing some minions to get at least 3 counters here. Play then [Flight of the Valkyrior](/card/25008), change to AE. \r\n\r\n**Bloodbath:**\r\nNow you are in AE with a hand of 6 cards. Use recover only, if you have [Quick Strike](/card/25018) at hand. Use [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) to go to 9 cards. Change to hero form. Use [Chooser of the Slain](/card/25010) to collect minions, and drawing even further cards. If possible, use [The Bifrost](/card/25023) to call for [Angela](/card/18011) (no cost, +1 Minion). Perhaps use [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) to collect further minions and thwarting. Use [\"Bring It!\"](/card/19030), if on your hand to even extend your hand further. Play [Death-Glow](/card/25002) to the first minion. Use your basic attack or [Quick Strike](/card/25018) to kill that minion. If there is a minion with more than 4 (5) health, let [Angela](/card/18011) attack first. Use [Valhalla](/card/25004) and [Flight of the Valkyrior](/card/25008), and [Chase Them Down](/card/01052) if threat is a problem. After killing the minion with [Death-Glow](/card/25002) attached, you will activate your hero. Attach [Death-Glow](/card/25002) to the next minion, rinse and repeat, until no minions are left, or you have only one card on your hand. Play [Death-Glow](/card/25002) on the Villain. If you have [Shieldmaiden](/card/25011) on your hand before turning to hero, spare that card. Last step: choose either to attack the villain or use [Smash the Problem](/card/25019) to thwart.\r\n\r\n**Shield maiden:**\r\nUnder ideal circumstances now there is no minion left, and the villain has [Death-Glow](/card/25002) attached. Perhaps you have one or two copies of [Shieldmaiden](/card/25011) on your hand, and thus can defend for yourself and perhaps someone else. You can also use [The Best Defense…](/card/25020) now. Once you get [Flight of the Valkyrior](/card/25008) on your hand, play it out and change to AE, repeat the bloodbath-step.\r\n\r\n**Last Thoughts:**\r\nYou should consider to use every [Godlike Stamina](/card/25024) you get your hands on, and remember, that card can also dump a stun, which can be very nasty in this build. This build is best for multiplayer, as threat can get a problem, when playing alone.","user_id":30510,"investigator_code":"25001a","investigator_name":"Valkyrie","slots":{"16043":1,"18011":1,"19030":2,"25002":1,"25003":1,"25004":1,"25005":1,"25006":1,"25007":1,"25008":2,"25009":1,"25010":2,"25011":2,"25012":3,"25013":1,"25014":1,"25018":2,"25019":2,"25020":2,"25023":1,"25024":3,"01052":2,"01055":1,"01057":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"06017":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer"},{"id":27145,"name":"Just rocket","date_creation":"2023-03-22T09:22:47+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-22T09:22:47+00:00","description_md":"asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd","user_id":31890,"investigator_code":"16029a","investigator_name":"Rocket Raccoon","slots":{"12013":1,"12015":1,"12016":1,"12017":1,"12018":1,"13024":1,"16020":1,"16030":2,"16031":2,"16032":1,"16033":2,"16034":2,"16035":1,"16036":1,"16037":1,"16038":2,"16039":1,"16047":1,"16052":1,"17022":1,"23035":1,"25034":1,"26036":1,"28018":1,"29017":1,"29020":1,"29027":1,"31029":1,"38028":1,"01067":1,"01072":1,"01073":1,"01074":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"03013":1,"04014":1,"04015":1,"04016":1,"08031":1,"09039":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"3.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":""},{"id":27146,"name":"Bruja Escarlata Desafío Calavera","date_creation":"2023-03-22T09:56:26+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-22T09:56:26+00:00","description_md":"Mazo con el que se realizó el desafío de vencer a [Calavera](/card/04059) en **Experto** con reglas especiales: Cada **arma** que se vincule genera oleada, y le da firmeza al villano.\r\n\r\nPodemos ver la partida y la descripción del mazo en el siguiente enlace\r\n[![Podemos ver la partida y la descripción del mazo en el siguiente enlace](https://img.youtube.com/vi/EQqxadbDZ9w/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/EQqxadbDZ9w)","user_id":15388,"investigator_code":"15001a","investigator_name":"Scarlet Witch","slots":{"14018":1,"15002":1,"15003":1,"15004":4,"15005":3,"15006":1,"15007":1,"15008":3,"15009":1,"15010":1,"15011":1,"15015":3,"15019":3,"20029":1,"21050":1,"01062":2,"01065":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"04047":1,"04049":3,"05023":1,"06031":1,"08023":1,"09026":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":27147,"name":"Scarlet Witch - Turbo Avengers (Esp/Eng)","date_creation":"2023-03-22T11:07:53+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-22T14:39:49+00:00","description_md":"ESP\r\n\r\nLa idea es sencilla.

Turn 1 [Multiple Man](/card/14012) is the best set-up you can get.  So mulligan hard for double resources and [Multiple Man](/card/14012).\r\n\r\n### Build Your Defense\r\nLoose order of priority:\r\n- Draw to help build once you start defending: [Unflappable](/card/09020), [Spider-Sense](/card/20009)\r\n- Permanent Defensive Boosts: [Venom's Pistol](/card/20010), [Armored Vest](/card/01081), [Booster Boots](/card/16052)\r\n- Maintain the Game: [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017), [Multi-Gun](/card/20008)\r\n- Temporary Defensive Boosts: [Judoka Skill](/card/38014), [Energy Barrier](/card/05017)\r\n- Progress the Game: [Dauntless](/card/16016), [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031)\r\n- Maintain Dauntless: [Endurance](/card/05023), [The Night Nurse](/card/09019), [Project Rebirth 2.0](/card/20007)\r\n\r\n### READY to Close Out the Game\r\n\r\n[Repurpose](/card/31016) - Discard [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) that have a single token left to ready after a defend for big damage/thwart.\r\n\r\n[Desperate Defense](/card/09015) - Ready after a defense activations.\r\n\r\n[Run and Gun](/card/20005) - Ready every for activations.\r\n\r\n### Other Notes:\r\n- Potential Defense: Base (2), [Armored Vest](/card/14016) (1), [Venom's Pistol](/card/20010) (up to 2), [Booster Boots](/card/16052) (1).  That's damage defended before you start spending counters off of [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) (up to 3) or [Judoka Skill](/card/38014) (2).  If you're using [Desperate Defense](/card/09015) that's an additional 2 defense (not going to count multiple).  Altogether you could achieve 13 Damage defense from a single attack.  Generally you should never need 13 defense, so I'd at least have a good idea of max potential boost icon in the deck and target that as your number for defense.  If you know you're going to to be ready after defending, it may be worth not using [Venom's Pistol](/card/20010) to save for a basic ATK or THW.\r\n- Extra Attacks: If extra attacks are pulled in the encounter phase, you might not always be ready.  [Multiple Man](/card/14012) of course can serve the purpose of being prepared for a defend.  [Grasping Tendrils](/card/20003) is another great alternative to [Multiple Man](/card/14012) for buying early game time to build out.  Also great to eat surprise extra attacks from the encounter deck.  Also this is probably the more likely time you will utilize [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) & [Judoka Skill](/card/38014) tokens, possible [Booster Boots](/card/16052) if you didn't have to for your first defense.\r\n- [Behind Enemy Lines](/card/20002) - Is great to help maintain the game  threat but also great to leave a confuse on the Villian for Treachery based scheming and/or going to AE for [Project Rebirth 2.0](/card/20007).\r\n- [Savage Attack](/card/20006) - Is good at exactly what you think it's good for, handling minions while building and closing out the game later.\r\n- Remember, you can use Venom's Symbiotic Bond and absorb the damage with [Energy Barrier](/card/05017).  Help you maintain [Dauntless](/card/16016) and still get his resource advantage.\r\n\r\n### FLEXIBLE SPOTS:\r\n\r\nNo specific slots are flexible.  But depending on the scenario some cards may be better than others.  Scenario dependent cards: [Multiple Man](/card/14012), [The Night Nurse](/card/09019), [Repurpose](/card/31016)/[Energy Barrier](/card/05017), [Judoka Skill](/card/38014)\r\n\r\n### ALTERNATE CONSIDERATIONS:\r\n\r\nMore [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017) - Depending on the scenario, more may be better if you might struggle with Main Scheme threat.\r\n\r\n[Defiance](/card/26018)/[Expert Defense](/card/03033) - Don't think the extra defense cards are needed.\r\n\r\n[Powerful Punch](/card/32014) - In a minion heavy scenario, this may be better than the Repurpose package.\r\n\r\n[The Power of Protection](/card/01079) - Could justify that this could see a 1 of with the current configuration, but you shouldn't need most of the 2+ protection cards until mid-game where it shouldn't matter.   [Powerful Punch](/card/32014) in the deck per the above though could certainly justify the addition.\r\n\r\n[Not Today!](/card/38016) - If the scenario has a lot of side schemes, then this might need to be in the deck.","user_id":26151,"investigator_code":"20001a","investigator_name":"Venom","slots":{"10031":1,"14012":3,"16016":1,"16017":1,"16052":1,"20002":2,"20003":2,"20004":1,"20005":3,"20006":2,"20007":1,"20008":1,"20009":1,"20010":2,"31016":3,"38014":2,"01081":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"05017":3,"05023":1,"09015":3,"09019":1,"09020":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":27150,"name":"Miles Morales |DEFINITIVO","date_creation":"2023-03-22T16:29:46+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-23T20:52:40+00:00","description_md":"Soy Gambito, creador de contenido de Marvel Champions en https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7NAIkZkK4zuNCsOvSFhh0w","user_id":17799,"investigator_code":"27030a","investigator_name":"Spider-Man","slots":{"10014":3,"10018":1,"13018":1,"18012":3,"27019":1,"27031":2,"27032":2,"27033":2,"27034":3,"27035":1,"27036":1,"27037":1,"27038":1,"27039":2,"27048":1,"27049":1,"28018":1,"28020":1,"01055":2,"01083":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1,"04040":1,"04043":3,"05023":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"2.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"solo, theme"},{"id":27151,"name":"Black Widow |DEFINITIVO","date_creation":"2023-03-22T16:40:11+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-24T22:38:32+00:00","description_md":"Soy Gambito, creador de contenido de Marvel Champions en https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7NAIkZkK4zuNCsOvSFhh0w","user_id":17799,"investigator_code":"08001a","investigator_name":"Black Widow","slots":{"27040":1,"27044":2,"27046":1,"27054":1,"37015":3,"01062":2,"01064":2,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1,"06031":1,"08002":1,"08003":2,"08004":2,"08005":1,"08006":2,"08007":2,"08008":2,"08009":1,"08010":2,"08011":1,"08012":1,"08017":1,"08018":3,"08023":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"2.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":"solo, theme"},{"id":27152,"name":"Captain America: \"We Can Do This All Day!\"","date_creation":"2023-03-22T17:24:37+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-22T17:24:37+00:00","description_md":"#### **Gameplan**\r\n[Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) allows Cap to go nuts with his readying ability. The deck also runs additional readying cards like [Desperate Defense](/card/09015) and [Indomitable](/card/01082) to get even more value out of the Suit.\r\n * **Mulligan:** prioritize finding [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) > [Super-Soldier Serum](/card/03010) > [Armored Vest](/card/01081) > [Unflappable](/card/09020) > [Quincarrier](/card/08023).\r\n * **Earlygame:** set up [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191), [Super-Soldier Serum](/card/03010), [Armored Vest](/card/01081), [Unflappable](/card/09020), and [Quincarrier](/card/08023). You want to start defending from the 1st turn. Ideally you can also start drawing cards from [Unflappable](/card/09020) ASAP.\r\n * **Midgame:** setup some [Indomitable](/card/01082) along with the rest of the missing upgrades. The goal is to continue dealing with everything while taking minimal damage. \r\n * **Lategame:** once everything is set up, you can constantly deal 6+ damage to the Villain while taking minimal damage thanks to all the ready effects. It shouldn't take long to close out the game when added to all of the incidental damage from Retaliate + [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031) they've taken over the course of the game.  \r\n\r\n#### **Card choices:**\r\n * [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191): juices up Cap's ability to ready. The +10 HP also enables [Dauntless](/card/16016)\r\n * [Desperate Defense](/card/09015): readies Cap to take advantage of [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191). 7 defense should be enough for most attacks.\r\n * [Never Back Down](/card/14014): the stun is a virtual ready because it allows Cap to not have to exhaust during the villain turn. \r\n * [Defiance](/card/26018): with 5 base defense, discarding any boost essentially guarantees a full block most of the time for 0 cost and this also prevents any special boost icons from showing up. \r\n * [Armored Vest](/card/01081): persistent defense bonus.\r\n * [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031): persistent incidental damage for cheap.\r\n * [Dauntless](/card/16016): another source of incidental damage enabled by [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191).\r\n * [Unflappable](/card/09020): extra cards for doing what you want to be doing anyway.\r\n * [The Night Nurse](/card/09019): cheap source of healing that can also remove status cards.\r\n * [Med Team](/card/01080): good chunk of healing without having to swap to Steve so you can keep blocking every turn. Also turns [Agent 13](/card/03002) into a pretty good thwarting machine.\r\n * [Black Widow](/card/01075): emergency re-roll for any particularly bad Encounters.\r\n * [Jocasta](/card/26013): virtual hand-size increase and 4 thwarts.\r\n\r\n**Cards not included:**\r\n * [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014)/[Jump Flip](/card/27014)/[Not Today!](/card/38016)/etc.: these are worse than [Defiance](/card/26018)/[Expert Defense](/card/03033) in b/c of the cost. 1 card = 2 dmg/thwart already from Cap's ability.\r\n * [Expert Defense](/card/03033): fine card to defend but doesn't provide any  synergy with [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191).\r\n * [Flow Like Water](/card/26016): requires you to play a card to trigger it so it's not guaranteed like [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031). \r\n * [Energy Barrier](/card/05017): this version is trying to abuse the readying cards and needed to make room for [Indomitable](/card/01082). This card was not synergistic with that game plan.\r\n\r\n**Strengths**\r\n * Excellent damage mitigation. You will rarely have to swap to Steve so you should be able to consistently do chip damage via Retaliate + [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031) + [Dauntless](/card/16016) while drawing with [Unflappable](/card/09020).\r\n * Can handle multiple small/medium minions well via Retaliate and [Shield Toss](/card/03006). \r\n * This version can scale well with player count due to all of the ready effects, you can block for other players often.\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\n * Can get overwhelmed by side schemes. Mostly reliant on [Fearless Determination](/card/03003) and [U.S. Agent](/card/04014) to control threat. Fortunately you shouldn't have to swap to Steve very often.\r\n * The extra encounter from [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) can be problematic vs certain villains.","user_id":14718,"investigator_code":"03001a","investigator_name":"Captain America","slots":{"10031":1,"14014":3,"16016":1,"26013":1,"26018":3,"27191":1,"01075":1,"01080":1,"01081":1,"01082":3,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"03002":1,"03003":2,"03004":3,"03005":2,"03006":2,"03007":1,"03008":1,"03009":1,"03010":2,"08023":1,"09015":3,"09019":1,"09020":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer"},{"id":27153,"name":"Ms. Marvel Solo Thwart TTS","date_creation":"2023-03-22T19:09:36+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-22T19:09:36+00:00","description_md":"Just a deck for TTS.

I was thinking of the dark Spiderman with Venom \"coating\". And I wanted to give him Weapons, which the standard Spiderman in my eyes would not touch.\r\n\r\nSo basically everything is about [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) and an aggression-based build.\r\n\r\nWith [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) Spiderman is quite tough, while having enhanced basic values and hand size. The tanky build brings a lot of hit point loss, perfectly balanced by the huge amount of regeneration [Aunt May](/card/01006) gives you. So beneath [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191), [Aunt May](/card/01006) is a very important part of the build. You will have a lot of damage potential with cards like [Swinging Web Kick](/card/01005), [Hand Cannon](/card/16046) (especially in combination with [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) and [Combat Training](/card/01057)), minion control with [Into the Fray](/card/13013), while the potential of this card as thwarting machine is enhanced by [Honed Technique](/card/28017) and [Follow Through](/card/16045). The latter also helps you with the Overkill-Damage caused by [Hand Cannon](/card/16046), perfectly for taking out several low-life minions. And it gives a decent amount of Healing when used in combination with [Moment of Triumph](/card/12030). [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) helps you together with [Angela](/card/18011) get your minions for the upper tactics, even giving you thwarting or damage on top.\r\nFurhter help with your Damage is given in a constant way by your allies: [Black Cat](/card/01002), the standard spidey-ally with no consequential damage, further enhanced by [Sidearm](/card/23035), and [Bug](/card/16040) enhanced with [Energy Spear](/card/22032), and always clearing the consquential damage when using your basic attack can do some amount of damage. \r\n[Nick Fury](/card/01084) is sort of your joker when things get complicated and [Tenacity](/card/01093) lets you reactivate to use another basic attack (for example).\r\nFor resource issues, which will almost never be a problem due to your spider-sense-ability, I added [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091) to the deck.\r\n\r\nSo, turn to your darker side, and get ready to shoot. But be aware of the negative effects of the suit (additional treachery card!).

Perfect Match-Up series found here: https://youtu.be/1I2q3sT6FoA Please check out the channel and the video since I thought it was an amazing gift to the community and it inspired me to start playing Champions more regularly.\r\n\r\nMy goal with this series is to create a unique deck inspired by each challenge match-up in the video using all the suggested cards plus some of my own to create a deck that any player can use to check out the challenge. If you’re missing some cards from a deck please ask in the comments and I’ll do my best to find replacements from your collection so that you can have fun too! Hopefully I can build a deck that can beat the villain on both standard and expert. I’ll try to document any tweaks I made while playing the deck too. \r\n\r\nThankfully we’re starting off easy with Rhino Vs Spider-Man (Protection). I played this match up 4 times. I won my first game on standard and then lost my first game on expert. I swapped out a couple cards and this is the final deck which defeated expert Rhino two times in a row without much issue(obviously Rhinos 7 threat threshold means you can sometimes just have a real bad draw that knocks you out instantly but I think the deck will win most of the time)\r\n\r\nThe set up here is fairly simple. Because you don’t really ever want Rhino to scheme, we will probably only stay as Peter Parker for the very first turn and then stay as Spider-Man the rest of the game. Since most of our defense events are useless in the opening hand, I’d recommend trying to mulligan for an Ally and/or 2-3 upgrades that you can lay down on the very first turn. \r\n\r\nLet’s look the allies and upgrades first:\r\n\r\n[Jocasta](/card/26013) / [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012) : If you're playing on  standard getting an ally in your opening hand is less important but they will be a huge help in expert since taking out the Breakin and Takin side scheme will be a the most important step to your success. Playing down either of these allies along with Spider-Man will get you the three THW needed to clear the side scheme. If you have Jocasta, hopefully you can pay for an upgrade with a defensive event so that you can then immediately pass it to her for the opening round against Rhino. If you have Brother Voodoo then you will almost always get to draw an extra event which you can use to play down some more upgrades.\r\n\r\nAs far as upgrades, I would say to prioritize defense over offense since you want to stabilize the game state for more consistent victories. \r\n\r\n[Armored Vest](/card/01081) will get you to 4 Defense. This should help prevent you taking most damage from Rhino when paired with your defense events. \r\n\r\nYou definitely want to try and get at least 1 copy of [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017) out early so that you can stop the 1 threat added to the main scheme automatically each round. A second copy will put you on the offensive, removing more threat than is naturally added.\r\n\r\n[Unflappable](/card/38013) will help you replace the defensive events you use after being attacked and [Nerves of Steel](/card/14017) will help you pay for your events.\r\n\r\nOn offense we have [Flow Like Water](/card/26016) that will rack up extra points of damage for your events and [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031) will deal damage every time you defend.\r\n\r\nFor events you have: \r\n\r\n[Desperate Defense](/card/09015) to block big attacks and ready Spiderman so he can either defend again or attack and thwart as needed. If side schemes are out or the threat is building because of an advance, you can use [Not Today!](/card/38016) for a big defense and remove some threat. This was the card I added to the deck after my loss, removing some of my damaging events because I wanted to make sure I could remove threat from multiple side schemes if necessary.  [Jump Flip](/card/27014) can also prevent damage and remove threat but remember that you have to take damage to use it. In a pinch it may be worth taking a hit to the face in order to remove threat.\r\n\r\n[Powerful Punch](/card/32014) that can be used to stop a minion before they start and [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) to retaliate with some more damage after being attacked. [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014) can also protect you from big boosts and push that damage back on Rhino. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Spider-Man's built in kit, I want to caution the use of [Webbed Up](/card/01009). Most of your damage and threat removal comes from defending so if you dont allow Rhino to attack, it can be especially difficult to remove threat efficiently. Similarly [Aunt May](/card/01006) is probably not needed since you will most likely never flip down. \r\n\r\nOne final tip: Don't forget to draw your cards!

Perfect Match-Up series found here: https://youtu.be/1I2q3sT6FoA Please check out the channel and the video since I thought it was an amazing gift to the community and it inspired me to start playing Champions more regularly.\r\n\r\nMy goal with this series is to create a unique deck inspired by each challenge match-up in the video using all the suggested cards plus some of my own to create a deck that any player can use to check out the challenge. If you’re missing some cards from a deck please ask in the comments and I’ll do my best to find replacements from your collection so that you can have fun too! Hopefully I can build a deck that can beat the villain on both standard and expert. I’ll try to document any tweaks I made while playing the deck too.\r\n\r\nThe second Match-up is Colossus Vs Magog. Playing this scenario was the first time I played Colossus and the first time a played Magog and I had a great time! Using Colossus ability to constantly gain Tough status helps prevent Magog from getting the ratings counters he needs to win. Magog does have a random modular set from MojoMania in each fight so there can be a varied degree of difficulty here. I played 3 games against Magog and won all three. The first was on standard with Horror modular, the second on expert with Sci-fi and the third on expert with Fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe core concept for this deck is to use a slew of Xmen allies to take care of your thwarting so that Colossus can do what he does best: smash the opponents face in.\r\n\r\nTo this end, our allies are our strongest feature. With the exception of [Angel](/card/33019), all of our Allies have at least 2 THW which can be boosted to 3 with [Mission Training](/card/34016). Honestly this is the first time I used [Mission Training](/card/34016) since it came out and I'm completely sold. 2 additional hit points on your X-men means they will put in double the work of a regular ally for 2 additional cost(the card+the resource to play it). \r\n\r\nColossus wants to flip regularly in order to benefit from his larger hand size, [Piotr's Studio](/card/32003) and Armor Up, and having allies with lots of THW allows him to do this without fear of the scheme popping constantly. [Under Surveillance](/card/06031) can be a huge help here and I play it any time its in my hand since a 10 scheme threshold instead of 6 allows for a good amount of breathing room in solo play. \r\n\r\nLooking at his supports and upgrades, most are either for defense or for resource production. [Titanium Muscles](/card/32005) can provide some generous resource power when paired with [Bulletproof Protector](/card/32009) and [Iron Will](/card/32004). The card draw from Iron Will can be huge, especially when paired with [Organic Steel](/card/32006) to provide multiple instances of Tough. [The X-Jet](/card/32020) provides a wild resource every round and [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) on Colossus allows you to use it in alter-ego as well. [Team-Building Exercise](/card/12024) helps pay for more X-men and [Utopia](/card/33020) helps you keep more allies out as well as some bonus readying. [Deft Focus](/card/16024) can supply your superpower needs and [Unshakable](/card/31024) can help protect you from the dreaded stun that can slow Colossus to a halt. \r\n\r\n[Made of Rage](/card/32007) and [Steel Fist](/card/32008) will be your primary damage dealers. [Clear the Area](/card/04049) can provide a bit of extra thwarting power if needed and [Game Time](/card/33022) can give your ally an extra usage in a time of need. I will say that you should be wary with [One Way or Another](/card/22015). I mainly use it to pull out [Pump Up the Crowd](/card/39008) so that I can gain additional ratings counters but make sure you pull it when you have enough THW to dispatch it the same turn. The other side schemes can vary but some are quite punishing. Definitely pull [ICE-Teroid M](/card/39059) when there are no minions in play but I would not play  [One Way or Another](/card/22015) if thats the only side scheme in the deck and you're already facing down two minions.\r\n\r\nOverall I found this to be an incredibly fun match-up. Keep in mind that the same amount of ratings counters are added from the main scheme popping as for taking damage from Magog so its almost always better to flip down if you have no Tough protection, even if it would mean the main scheme gets completed. Also be wary of [Werewolf Pack](/card/39052). In my standard game I played [Bishop](/card/37011) with [Mission Training](/card/34016) on the first turn and he was immediately defeated by [Werewolf Pack](/card/39052).

Anytime you need a little extra damage or threat removal to clear an enemy/side scheme, touch any ally. A Basic ally touched with Superpower Adaptation will let you pick up your Spiritual Meditation cards, but touch Gambit when possible to pick up a Bulletproof Belle. Touch the villain to get more out of Bulletproof Belle before you use it. Touch minions to get more out of Southern Cross. You'll have to read the board state when you have multiple options in hand, but this strategy makes your deck very flexible.\r\n\r\nTo stay up when you want to, lean into Bulletproof Belle and try to keep at least one chump blocker out besides a mystic.  You have to flip down for Mutant Education use, but that keeps you loaded with BBs and Southern Crosses.

This deck helps her keep allies in the field so she has access to Aerial for Southern Cross and Goin Rogue. Two big events she needs to get the most out of at every opportunity. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the deck is just meant to keep allies alive as long as possible to get the most out of them while they're in play to support Rogue's main two events. \r\n\r\nBulletproof Belle is a great defense card with the added bonus of adding a retaliate damage for a defense that already prevents all damage and makes Rogue tough.\r\n\r\nIn solo, she bounces Touched between the villain or an ally as needed to make the most of her hand. If a minion pops up she can move Touched to it for overkill. \r\nSuperpower Adaptation becomes a resource card in solo. In multiplayer she can use it to play whatever event from other players is the most helpful at any given time. \r\n\r\nShe can use allies to help block in multiplayer and not always just as chump blockers with the added support they gain from Protective Training. They are then able to ready with Hangar Bay. Utopia and Game Time help keep Allies and your hero ready as well on your turn when needed. Then you have Med Team and X-mansion to heal them up again for the next round. \r\n\r\nMutant Protector gets your expensive allies out cheap and is ideally played with Rockslide, Colossus or even Armor who can survive their initial defense. \r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer can help with damage, healing, and readying if you ever end up using it with everything else you have going on.\r\n\r\nI've seen people lean on the trait aspect of Touched a lot trying to make Rogue a Mystic or Guardian to use cards she otherwise couldn't, but to me the ability to gain Aerial, Retaliate 1, Stalwart, or Overkill whenever you want and get extra damage/thwarting, card draw, or drop a stun or confused on top of that is the way bigger deal. She needs other characters in play to get the most out of that. \r\n\r\nI've only tested this deck a couple of times, but it's working pretty well so far.

Then it's time to pull an Uno Reverse card and instead have your allies turn your hero into a Guardian!** \r\n\r\n**_And then we give [Gamora](/card/19020) an [Energy Spear](/card/22032) and heal her forever._**\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThrough the power of [Touched](/card/38002), Rogue can tap into the crazy potential of [Gamora](/card/19020) and [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) with [Energy Spear](/card/22032)s. And, through the power of [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009), you have the potential to use [First Aid](/card/01086) SIX times per deck pass to keep them alive forever!\r\n\r\nNow, putting [Touched](/card/38002) on an ally means that [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008) won't work and that many of your events miss out on their most powerful effect. So what does that actually mean? It means that we have to be getting HUGE value from our allies when we put [Touched](/card/38002) on them to outweigh these lost opportunities. And so we have:\r\n\r\n**[Gamora](/card/19020) + [Energy Spear](/card/22032) + [Sidearm](/card/23035) + [Boot Camp](/card/13016) = 6 ATK + 1 card draw per use.**\r\n\r\n**[Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) + [Energy Spear](/card/22032) + [Sidearm](/card/23035) + [Boot Camp](/card/13016) = 8 ATK with overkill (on minions) per use.**\r\n\r\nNow, [First Aid](/card/01086) is just 2 hp from one perspective - but from most allies' perspective? 2 more hp means you can get two more uses from them! \r\n\r\n**[First Aid](/card/01086) giving either ally two more uses? = 16 damage OR 12 damage and 2 card draw!**\r\n\r\n12 damage + 2 card draw? 16 damage? For a 1-cost card?! Now that's HUGE value. And so in using [Touched](/card/38002) to set this up, both to play our allies and heal them? We're effectively exceeding the value of Rogue's own cards. Even before you've fully upgraded an ally, they are still very efficient. And most of all? It's _fun_!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n_Note: [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) and [X-Mansion](/card/32049) are great at healing too, but it's just two hoops too many to jump through on top of playing [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) and [Gamora](/card/19020) in the first place._\r\n\r\n_Note: If you're wondering why I've not included the other Guardian toys, I've addressed them each in a later section!_\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Early Game: **\r\n<hr>\r\n> ###### **Rocket:** \"Welcome to the Guardians of the frickin' Galaxy!\" Only he didn't use _\"frickin'_.\"\r\n\r\nYour mulligan priorities are: any of your resource generators and your unrestricted Guardian allies. [X-Gene](/card/38019), [The X-Jet](/card/32020), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), and [Deft Focus](/card/16024). [Bug](/card/16040), [Cosmo](/card/17020), [Marvel Boy](/card/21041), and [Throg](/card/25014).\r\n\r\nRogue sometimes struggles to manage the high cost of her events and play anything else on the side - resource generators really open this up and it's essential to try and get 1-2 out early. With just one resource generator out, you can play [Southern Cross](/card/38006) and [First Aid](/card/01086).\r\n\r\nAnd [Bug](/card/16040) and [Cosmo](/card/17020) are the best Guardians to open the way to playing either or both of [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) and [Gamora](/card/19020), but any 2-cost Guardian is great!\r\n\r\nYou can also play [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020) on Turn #1, but it requires drawing one of them, a double resource, and either [Bug](/card/16040), [Cosmo](/card/17020), or [Marvel Boy](/card/21041). Which is highly unlikely - but potentially worth it if the stars align.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a resource generator and Guardian ally in play, the aim of the game is to maintain as much control as you can until either [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020) arrives. They are high-priority, and once you play them? The game opens up massively and starts to swing in your favour.\r\n\r\nThere are four Guardian allies in the deck that do not require the Guardian trait to play them - it's important to get one in play and keep it in play until you find either of your two key allies. Simply use [Touched](/card/38002) on any of them to play [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020)!\r\n\r\n[Bug](/card/16040) is the third-most important ally overall. While [Gambit](/card/38003) is also good and definitely the fourth-most important ally, we are building to use [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) on one of our basic allies which lowers his value of letting us grab our own hero events.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Mid Game**\r\n<hr>\r\n> ###### **Gamora:** “We’re just like Kevin Bacon!” \r\n\r\nThe general gameplan is to aim to achieve a board state where you have 3-4 resource generators out (potentially including [Gamora](/card/19020)) and two of [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019), [Gamora](/card/19020) and [Bug](/card/16040) out with at least an [Energy Spear](/card/22032) each. With that said, it's _very_ possible to win with only one upgraded ally and 1-2 resource generators.\r\n\r\nYour upgraded allies should take care of most of the damage you need, but Rogue herself can make a big impact between her basic ATK and her various events. \r\n\r\nNote that, while Rocket is great for damage, if there's no minion out or if there's a particularly problematic side scheme? There's no harm in him thwarting for 2! You can also use [Gambit](/card/38003) for the same effect. But usually [War Room](/card/37030), 3x [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005), [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) and [Professor X](/card/32019) do all the heavy lifting when it comes threat removal in solo play.\r\n\r\nIf you draw [First Aid](/card/01086)? Then [Touched](/card/38002) can often just go on the villain, letting you unleash stuns, confuse, and later use [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008). Likewise, [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) is an incredible card you can use after first putting [Touched](/card/38002) on a non-villain character, benefiting from that placement, and then use it to move it to the villain.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that, just because you are often using [Touched](/card/38002) on ally, it doesn't mean you have to miss out on all the status effects that her events can dish out!\r\n\r\nIf you end up with too many [First Aid](/card/01086)s for your ally-healing needs and no better way to spend it? Play it anyway. Heal yourself or another player/their ally. It's not _that_ efficient when used to heal a hero, but it's also pretty handy! Healing while in hero form can add a lot of flexibility and there are few cards in the game that do so unconditionally like this.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, [Plan B](/card/27024) is excellent for Rogue. Not only is it convenient disposal for any excess cards you might have in hand after playing her big events, but you can feed it the treachery card from her nemesis set (Misled) that enters your hand!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The End Game:**\r\n<hr>\r\n> ###### **Rocket:** \"That's for if things get _really_ hardcore. Or if you wanna _blow up moons_.\"  \r\n> ###### **Gamora:** \"No one's blowing up moons.\"  \r\n> ###### **Rocket:** \"...You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.\"  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to ending the game, this deck doesn't have one incredibly high-damage combo in its pocket to obliterate the enemy. Instead, it overwhelms with incredible tempo.\r\n\r\nOnce you have reached the point of 3-4 resource generators and 1-2 upgraded allies? The game should largely take care of itself. You can deal devastating damage, remove buckets of threat, and Rogue is naturally very tanky with high survivability. Control the board and feed the excess resources and ally-uses into the villain's face as damage.\r\n\r\nThen you win.\r\n\r\n_However_, with just three resource generators in play or two with a double resource in hand, you can play 2x [Southern Cross](/card/38006) on one turn. You can even keep one in hand when your turn ends to try and fish for another if the board is well-controlled but you know the villain's final form is deadly.\r\n\r\nIf you put [Touched](/card/38002) on an ally, you can deal 16 damage with 2x [Southern Cross](/card/38006)! And ideally you'll have an ally or two with 4+ ATK along with Rogue herself! In solo play, using your allies and Rogue alongside 2x [Southern Cross](/card/38006) will end most villain's final stages in one go - even on Expert.\r\n\r\nIf [Gambit](/card/38003) is out, it's those times near the end of the game that [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) really shines on him here to get you those [Southern Cross](/card/38006)es.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Other Guardian Cards?**\r\n<hr>\r\nRogue gives up a lot by focusing on trait-specific cards - so if they're not reliably giving you as lot of value? They are generally not worth keeping. **Read on if you want to see the reasoning on why I didn't include each, else skip this section!** \r\n\r\nI originally included all of the Guardian cards, and multiple games were going by where I would barely play them or I would play them and wouldn't get value from them. Simply put, they were very inconsistent or completely unnecessary.  \r\n\r\n- [Knowhere](/card/17022) seems like an auto-include in a deck focused on Guardian allies, right? But when the deck is about keeping said allies alive, you're not playing that many of them. A [Knowhere](/card/17022) on Turn #1 is great, but once any two of [Bug](/card/16040), [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020) are in play? A mid-to-late game [Knowhere](/card/17022) isn't getting you much value at all.\r\n\r\n- CITT seems great in combination with [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004), but trying to play it and other stat boosts alongside the rest of the Aggression Guardians' kit is just too much setup for not enough gain. If you were focused heavily on your ATK stat, then maybe, but otherwise it's my opinion that [Plan B](/card/27024) generally outclasses it.\r\n\r\n- [Booster Boots](/card/16052) is a good card in a deck where you don't want to block with allies - but on a hero with with so many stuns, confuses, and tough cards (that are used despite it often touching an ally), it will only occasionally be useful. Worse is that it comes with the risk of discarding [Gamora](/card/19020) or [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019)! And that can really shut down your plans.\r\n\r\n- [Honorary Guardian](/card/22035) was great when I had more of the above cards in play. After trying and removing each of them? [Honorary Guardian](/card/22035) only serves to make it slightly easier to play [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020). But since [Touched](/card/38002) already makes that easy, it was just not worth keeping.\r\n\r\n- [Angela](/card/18011) can be good, but she is something of a \"_win more_\" card in my opinion. She's great if you're already ahead and set up, but bad if you're behind and struggling. If you already have two minions out, a nasty side scheme, and you're low hp? You are not playing Angela and creating another problem for yourself. If you are already setup with no trouble in sight and [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) is bored? You are probably winning anyway. There are exceptions, and she gets better in scenarios with weak minions and should likely be included there anyway, but against tougher scenarios she just wasn't ever hitting the table.\r\n\r\n- [Groot](/card/16047) and [Drax](/card/18019) are both good allies in very different ways, but Rogue doesn't need the defense and [Energy Spear](/card/22032) already turns allies like [Bug](/card/16040) and [Gamora](/card/19020) into villain slayers.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Alternative Cards:**\r\n<hr>\r\nIn addition to experimenting with some of the additional Guardian cards featured in the previous section, there are some other cards with great potential with Rogue and may better suit your playstyle or make great substitutions for cards you don't own:\r\n\r\n- [Angel](/card/33019) - He's 2-cost for Rogue, can deal 4 damage and then block. That's great value. More importantly? He is a basic ally and has Aerial. This means we can put [Touched](/card/38002) on him, use [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) to draw [First Aid](/card/01086), then move [Touched](/card/38002) with [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) and retain his Aerial trait to power up our other events.\r\n\r\n- [Vivian](/card/26003) - Much like Angel, she is another Aerial hero who can help us fetch [First Aid](/card/01086) while also having an incredibly useful response!\r\n\r\n- [Assess the Situation](/card/12033) - Much like the Storm hero, Rogue likes cheap cards to play around her expensive events. And nothing gets cheaper than a 0-cost card. Play this to bank an awkward resource and regain it on the next turn as another card. Digging through our deck faster with it also helps us find our best cards sooner.\r\n\r\n- [Beauty and the Thief](/card/37019) - If [Gambit](/card/38003) is in play? This card is one of the best. The issue is that Gambit is not always reliably out and, if playing solo, there is not always 4 threat to remove. Sometimes, unless the villain has schemed, there is only 1. And this, combined with a hero who has tons of threat removal, can often just make it unnecessary. With that said? Definitely include this if in multiplayer with Gambit.\r\n\r\n- [Skilled Strike](/card/09037) - So you've got out [Bug](/card/16040) or [Throg](/card/25014) but your other allies are hiding. What do you do with [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)? Ideally, you pitch it to play a different card. But, if you can't, then you need an Aggression event to find with it. I originally ran this deck with 2x [Skilled Strike](/card/09037) and, while I didn't use it much, it's certainly a nice cheap option to have if you want one.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n**Good luck and have fun!**\r\n<hr>","user_id":16053,"investigator_code":"38001a","investigator_name":"Rogue","slots":{"13016":1,"16019":1,"16024":1,"16040":1,"17020":1,"19020":1,"21041":1,"22032":3,"23035":1,"25014":1,"27024":1,"32019":1,"32020":1,"37030":1,"38002":1,"38003":1,"38004":1,"38005":3,"38006":3,"38007":2,"38008":2,"38009":3,"38019":1,"01086":3,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":26700,"name":"Guille Liderando Fenix","date_creation":"2023-03-08T12:41:12+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-08T12:41:12+00:00","description_md":"liderando XMen con la fuerza Phoenix","user_id":16298,"investigator_code":"34001a","investigator_name":"Phoenix","slots":{"12024":1,"32019":1,"32049":1,"33011":1,"33015":2,"33018":2,"33019":1,"33020":1,"34003":1,"34004":1,"34005":1,"34006":1,"34007":1,"34008":1,"34009":1,"34010":2,"34011":2,"34012":2,"34013":2,"34022":1,"34034":3,"36015":1,"36016":1,"36017":1,"36018":1,"36020":3,"36022":1,"38018":1,"38019":1,"38028":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"04016":1,"05023":1,"34002a":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"multiplayer"},{"id":26701,"name":"Captain Chema","date_creation":"2023-03-08T13:32:37+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-08T13:32:37+00:00","description_md":"a ver como funciona esto","user_id":16298,"investigator_code":"01010a","investigator_name":"Captain Marvel","slots":{"14030":1,"15011":1,"15013":3,"34020":2,"37013":2,"01011":1,"01012":3,"01013":3,"01014":2,"01015":1,"01016":1,"01017":2,"01018":2,"01060":3,"01065":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"04045":1,"04047":3,"05023":1,"08012":1,"08023":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":"multiplayer"},{"id":26702,"name":"Ironheart Justice -

Priorities will be on [The Golden City](/card/01045) > [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049) > [Avengers Tower](/card/03024) > [Quincarrier](/card/08023) > [Panther Claws](/card/01047) >[Tactical Genius](/card/01048)/[Energy Daggers](/card/01046). Allies are lower on the priority scale (except [Shuri](/card/01041) to fetch an upgrade and [Maria Hill](/card/01067) to help everyone develop) so don't be afraid to use them as resources.\r\n\r\nMidgame:\r\nAfter you've assembled most of your suits and supports, it's time to shift priorities to developing allies. You don't have to wait on using [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017). Drawing 2 cards is the goal and anything more is a bonus. You should also be using all of your [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043d).\r\n\r\nEndgame:\r\nThe endgame state is when you're able to keep 4+ allies on the field and drawing 4+ cards with [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) and playing multiple [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) each turn.\r\n\r\nCard choices:\r\n\r\n[Kaluu](/card/21014): the perfect card for this deck. Finds [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) and [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a). Can then defend and recycled with [Make the Call](/card/01071) on the next turn.\r\n\r\n[Maria Hill](/card/01067): very good at helping development during early and midgame where not being an Avenger doesn't matter for [Avengers Tower](/card/03024).\r\n\r\n[Captain America](/card/21011): should cost 2 or less (3+ Avenger allies + T'challa) most of the time and he's just good value at that price. His play pattern also lines up nicely with [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) (e.g. exhaust to draw, ready, defend an attack with Toughness).\r\n\r\n[Team Training](/card/04016): this lets you play [Ant-Man](/card/12011) for 0 cost and also use [Make the Call](/card/01071) on him. Overall also useful to get another activation out of your allies whenever you're not exhausting them to draw.\r\n\r\n[Mighty Avengers](/card/21015): this is more of a midgame card that doubles the effectiveness of most of your allies on turns you're not playing [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017). \r\n\r\nCards I chose not to include:\r\n\r\n[Avengers Assemble!](/card/03015): this is only useful in very narrow circumstances after you're already fully setup anyway and for the cost of playing it, you would rather play multiple [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) and replenish your ally count. And I would rather have the cards currently in the deck than this.\r\n\r\n[Band Together](/card/21018): early game is when you really need the resources and that's when this is the most useless.","user_id":14718,"investigator_code":"01040a","investigator_name":"Black

In need of good targets, well [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) is a THWART event that Gamora can play in any aspect.\r\n\r\n### Voltron\r\n\r\nWe have [Laser Blaster](/card/17019) and we are looking to buff up some Allies, well who better than [Yondu](/card/17013)?  He can hold Upgrades and attack every turn without taking consequential.  So added a few more permanent Upgrades to go with him: [Inspired](/card/01074) & [Sidearm](/card/23035).  Adding a [Leadership Skill](/card/36019) as well because it's just good for all our allies without having to be dependent on them surviving.  \r\n\r\n### Weapons\r\nWell, we now have 4 Weapons in the deck between [Sidearm](/card/23035), [Laser Blaster](/card/17019) & [Gamora's Sword](/card/18010).  We also have 3 more spots for off-aspect events.  [Fusillade](/card/20026) seems like a great fit for the deck.  None of the weapons care about being exhausted.  [Fusillade](/card/20026) packs a nice punch to soften up an enemy before a big overkill attack.\r\n\r\n### Allies\r\n\r\n[Groot](/card/16047) - [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) or a random Minion may not always line up when you want them.  Groot has a lot of HP and healing to sit and tank a Minion until we are ready to Overkill it.  Also, Groot holds [Inspired](/card/01074) pretty well for Thwarting.\r\n\r\n[Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) - Not much to say here other than he comes with 4 ATK vs Minions and gets overkill without other cards.  Also having 2 THW is pretty good.\r\n\r\n[Snowguard](/card/29023) - The most versatile option.  3 ATK and overkill is [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) light but her 3 ATK works on the Villian.  3 THW is great if you need the extra THW.  5 HP and Retaliate is great when [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) or a random Minion may not always line up when you want them.\r\n\r\n[Yondu](/card/17013) - All together, [Yondu](/card/17013) can reach 5 ATK before [Target Practice](/card/17017) with [Inspired](/card/01074), [Laser Blaster](/card/17019), [Sidearm](/card/23035), & [Leadership Skill](/card/36019) activation.  [Laser Blaster](/card/17019) giving him overkill makes the case.\r\n\r\n### The Plan\r\n\r\n- Get an Ally on the board with Overkill, attach a Weapon Upgrade to said Ally, and get some amount of [Target Practice](/card/17017) on board.\r\n- Get a minion on the board via luck or [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043).\r\n- Use [Gamora](/card/18001a) basic ATK or Attack Events to soften up the Minion HP to as close to 1 as possible.\r\n- Attack Minion with Ally that has overkill.\r\n- Trigger [Target Practice](/card/17017) to either a.) Get to the HP threshold of the Minion because we couldn't soften it up enough.  b.) Do more overkill damage.\r\n- Repeat\r\n\r\n### FLEXIBLE SPOTS:\r\n\r\n[Leadership Skill](/card/36019) - Not a weapon.\r\n\r\n[Inspired](/card/01074) - Not a weapon.\r\n\r\n[\"Welcome Aboard\"](/card/20027) - [Gamora](/card/18001a) doesn't have the greatest economy for things that aren't Attack or Thwart.  [Yondu](/card/17013) being leadership, 4 cost, and the other Allies being basic lead to the decision to go with this as my economy. 3x may be too many for the 5 allies in the deck currently but everything else is either playable with [Keen Instincts](/card/18009) or only costs 1.\r\n\r\n### ALTERNATE CONSIDERATIONS:\r\n\r\n[Major Victory](/card/21053)/[Command Team](/card/23016)/[Get Ready](/card/01069) - There isn't a ton of room for these types of effects.  I think if I was playing multi-player these could be a consideration over some amount of allies.\r\n\r\n[Maria Hill](/card/01067)/[Ironheart](/card/13018)/[Nick Fury](/card/01084) - Card draw allies to get you through to the cards.\r\n\r\n[Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) - Not enough allies but it would help in assembling things.\r\n\r\n[The Power in All of Us](/card/13024) - If [Yondu](/card/17013) wasn't Leadership, this would be in the deck.","user_id":26151,"investigator_code":"18001a","investigator_name":"Gamora","slots":{"16019":1,"16043":3,"16047":1,"17013":1,"17017":3,"17019":1,"18002":1,"18003":2,"18004":2,"18005":2,"18006":2,"18007":2,"18008":1,"18009":2,"18010":1,"20026":3,"20027":3,"23035":3,"29023":1,"36019":1,"01074":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"multiplayer, theme"},{"id":26790,"name":"Natasha Romanoff: Meditative Spy","date_creation":"2023-03-11T15:03:19+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-11T19:09:16+00:00","description_md":"## **Gameplan**\r\n\r\n- **Mulligan:** look for [Safe House #29](/card/08005), [Black Widow's Gauntlet](/card/08007), and [Meditation](/card/26036) primarily. If you have them already, you can fish for things to Meditate into.\r\n- **Early game:** develop [Safe House #29](/card/08005), [Black Widow's Gauntlet](/card/08007), [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), and [Beat Cop](/card/10029). Stay in alter-ego to take advantage of the virtually 7 card hand.\r\n- **Midgame:** set up to loop [Counterintelligence](/card/08017) every turn then start throwing in [Covert Ops](/card/08003) and allies to chip down the villain. \r\n- **Lategame:** set up some turns with [Attacrobatics](/card/08006) and [Grappling Hook](/card/08008) out to flip over to Widow and play [Dance of Death](/card/08004) for a burst of damage.\r\n\r\n## **Card choices:**\r\n\r\n * [Meditation](/card/26036): super efficient card for this deck since the plan is to stay in alter-ego the majority of the time and there's usually no other reason to exhaust Natasha. Ideally used for [Beat Cop](/card/10029), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), [Covert Ops](/card/08003), and allies. Its main downside is it's only usable once per turn so it can get awkward if you draw multiple on the same turn. But it's a strong enough card to hold onto an extra copy to use the next turn.\r\n * [Beat Cop](/card/10029): consistent threat control and works well with [Meditation](/card/26036).\r\n * [Helicarrier](/card/01092): playing this over [Quincarrier](/card/08023) b/c Quincarrier requires you to be an Avenger and won't work with [Meditation](/card/26036).\r\n * [Counterintelligence](/card/08017): this is the primary card to get with [Agent Coulson](/card/08011). With [Safe House #29](/card/08005) + 2 [Black Widow's Gauntlet](/card/08007)/[Helicarrier](/card/01092), you're preventing 3 threat (and drawing a card) every turn.\r\n * [Spycraft](/card/08018): this is mostly to get rid of a really really bad encounter ([Shadow of the Past](/card/01190) or any giant minions) but otherwise you just sit on it for insurance.\r\n * [Espionage](/card/08033): is a 1-cost Preparation (so useful for Mission Prep and [Winter Soldier](/card/08002)) that can potentially get you 2 cards (cost neutral) at some point in the future. \r\n * [Quake](/card/08012): you'll be in alter-ego most of the time so she's a consistent source of minion damage.\r\n * [Snowguard](/card/29023): 9 dmg for 5 effective cost (1.8 dmg per cost). With [Meditation](/card/26036) it becomes 9 dmg for 3 ec which is really good. I think she's better than [Daredevil](/card/01058) because she's more streamlined in what this deck needs (more damage).\r\n * [Determination](/card/21052): \"free\" threat removal (technically 1 effective cost but it's getting used to pay for another card anyway so the bonus is basically free). There are 11 1-cost cards so it lines up nicely with this.\r\n\r\n### **Cards not included:**\r\n\r\n * [Foiled!](/card/09038): the timing of this means you'll be down a card for the turns that you play it so even though it's printed as a 0 cost, it's effectively a 2 cost card for preventing 2 threat on average.\r\n * [Multitasking](/card/15013)/[Clear the Area](/card/04049)/[Skilled Investigator](/card/04047)/etc: the majority of the cards commonly played require you to be in Hero mode which you actively want to avoid.\r\n * [Turn the Tide](/card/15015): would only work with [Covert Ops](/card/08003) or her natural thwarting making it not reliable at all.\r\n\r\n### **Strengths**\r\n\r\n- Efficient threat control. Once set up, you're able to remove/prevent 6+ threat every turn.\r\n- Drawing lots of cards. Staying in Alter-ego will let you have a consistent 7 card hand.\r\n- Good resource management. Meditation + a lot of 1-cost cards + 7 card hand means there won't be many awkward turns where you're doing nothing.\r\n\r\n### **Weaknesses**\r\n\r\n- Low damage output. It will take a while to finish games.\r\n- Not very good minion control. Multiple minions will be problematic for this deck.","user_id":14718,"investigator_code":"08001a","investigator_name":"Black Widow","slots":{"10029":3,"22016":1,"26036":3,"29023":1,"01062":2,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"06031":1,"08002":1,"08003":2,"08004":2,"08005":1,"08006":2,"08007":2,"08008":2,"08009":1,"08010":2,"08011":1,"08012":1,"08017":2,"08018":2,"08033":2},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":26791,"name":"... And Justice For Thor","date_creation":"2023-03-11T17:31:34+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-15T16:21:19+00:00","description_md":"Thor's Have at Thee ability is once per phase, not per turn. I was looking for ways to trigger it during the Villain phase - enter S.H.I.E.L.D. support! With [Global Logistics](/card/27043) you can ensure that you see a minion quite consistently. With so many draws it allows you to _Load_ your hand and really fix-up Thor's economy. I was surprised that there were no Thor decks on here that include [Global Logistics](/card/27043).\r\n\r\nThe other advantage is that Justice makes up for Thor's lack of thwart. Adding [Surveillance Team](/card/01064), [Clear the Area](/card/04049) and a few allies round it out nicely.\r\n\r\nEarly on you want to get out a few resource generators, try to mulligan for at least one. Staying or switching back to alter-ego in the first few turns can be useful as you can get an extra card by spending [Mjolnir](/card/06009) and returning it with the Worthy ability. \r\n\r\nThe general strategy is to then draw out minions and side schemes without getting overwhelmed. Be careful to see how much thwart or attack you have to see what you can deal with. Later on you will have enough resources to _Ride the Lightning_ with [Hammer Throw](/card/06005) and [Lightning Strike](/card/06006). As Thor has 14 health you can sometimes afford to leave a minion out for an extra turn if you can't defeat it straight away, but eventually you will want to _Kill 'Em All_. \r\n\r\nYou have some very satisfying turns, such as starting with [_One_ Way or Another](/card/30017) to fetch a secondary scheme, [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) to defeat it, followed by [Turn the Tide](/card/15015) on the minion you just put into play.\r\n\r\nIt can be tricky to have the resources to finish off minions at times with Thor's cards, especially early on. You have cheap damage from your 3 attack stat (with [Mjolnir](/card/06009)) and [Limitless Stamina](/card/31023), or [Turn the Tide](/card/15015), which is ideal in this deck. [Sky-Destroyer](/card/27055) is a consistent source of damage here that helps weaken higher health minions.\r\n\r\nNote that for [Turn the Tide](/card/15015) it has to be the Thor that removes the threat - so make sure to use [Surveillance Team](/card/01064) first and [Clear the Area](/card/04049) or [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) last when clearing schemes.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the intro, [Global Logistics](/card/27043) is mostly used to ensure you will get a minion from an encounter card. In solo you can sometimes stack a minion for the next 2 turns with 1 use (if there is no surge or extra cards). It also allows you to avoid some of the worst treachery cards and know what will happen the next turn. This can allow you to safely switch into alter-ego for a turn to recover. Another nice part is that [Loki](/card/06028) becomes easier to deal with as you can ensure he will not discard a treachery.\r\n\r\n[Blindfold](/card/33014) can help with finding minions, especially when combined with [Cosmo](/card/17020). You just have to discard the appropriate number of cards before the minion to ensure you get it as an encounter rather than a boost. \r\n\r\nOf course when stacking the encounter deck you want to then avoid disturbing it - so make sure to use [One Way or Another](/card/22015) and [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) first. Keep a check on the number of cards in your deck too, to know when the extra encounter card will be taken. Also make a note of how many minions and side schemes there are in the scenario. It is good to keep track of how many are left in the encounter deck so that you don't waste a card with [One Way or Another](/card/22015) or [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003). It helps to know which side schemes are still left, as there are some you may want to avoid. \r\n\r\n[Helicarrier](/card/01092) is here because it helps with the S.H.I.E.L.D. support, in particular [Agent 13](/card/03002) who can ready it for another use. \r\n\r\nIt is 44 cards, but I could not see anything to take out. You draw through the deck quickly enough anyway. This deck is mostly aimed at solo play, but should be ok in 2-player too. For 3 and 4 player games it won't work as there will be 3/4 boost cards first, so [Global Logistics](/card/27043) cannot let you choose which encounter card you receive. \r\n\r\nI did consider removing [Agent Coulson](/card/08011) and [Counterintelligence](/card/08017), as early on it is difficult to have enough resources to play both the same turn. However, both cards are good individually - [Agent Coulson](/card/08011) is cheap if you consider the 1-card refund after playing him and [Counterintelligence](/card/08017) helps to safely go to alter-ego. I prefer that than confuse here: Given the space issues I would only be able to fit in one or two cards that confuse, which is then not very reliable against anything with Stalwart. If you did want to take those out it could give space for another [Limitless Stamina](/card/31023) or [Homeland Intervention](/card/27042).\r\n\r\nI had fun with this deck, there are plenty of decisions and drawing cards always feels good.

([Surprise Attack](/card/13014) is 0 cost when using [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) and Ant-Man is easy to flip.\r\n\r\n- [Combat Training](/card/01057) adds another +1 ATK.\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\n### **_Ideal Play:_**\r\n\r\n- With [Resize](/card/12005) and/or [Swarm Tactics](/card/12020) you'd like to flip from Tiny-form to Giant-form twice for +4 ATK, while playing as many low-cost (attack) events as you can, e.g. [Surprise Attack](/card/13014) or [Quick Strike](/card/25018).\r\n\r\n- You'll trigger [Fluid Motion](/card/28016) with those low-cost events for another +2 ATK.\r\n\r\n- With [Combat Training](/card/01057) down, you'll have around +7 ATK (10 ATK total). Your [Quick Strike](/card/25018) will have hit pretty hard with that increased attack.\r\n\r\n- Finally, with low-cost allies down you'll be able to then basic attack for 10 damage, and hopefully have a [Earth's Mightiest Heroes](/card/04022) in hand to swing again for another 10 damage or so.\r\n\r\n- [Swarm Tactics](/card/12020) and [Ready to Rumble](/card/21022) will also hopefully have contributed to another swing for you near that max damage.\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\n### **_Theme!:_**\r\n\r\n- In the spirit of Quantumania, you'll have two ally Wasp targets for [Swarm Tactics](/card/12020) when playing solo.

Hank Pym was actually the original Giant-Man! This ally is also quite effective in this deck in that you'll always be able to swing for 4-5 ATK. Late game this is an ideal target for [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) and [Reinforced Suit](/card/12018). (Check out the art on the suit!). [Teamwork](/card/06032) is another card that ensures your max attack by artificially increasing his health.\r\n\r\n- [Goliath](/card/04013) is another hero whose moniker was originally Hank Pym. You'll also get the most out of his ability with multiple attacks of 5-6 ATK with [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030). Wait for the right time to use his action, he's actually an excellent thwarter, especially with [Mighty Avengers](/card/21015) down.\r\n\r\n- Power-Man is yet another <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> recursion target that's also an ideal target for [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) to get the most out of his action of increased ATK in a phase.\r\n\r\n- [Black Panther](/card/01040a) is a recursion target that can also get you [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) when you haven't yet drawn it or recurred it.\r\n\r\n- U.S. Agent actually is not a bad target for [First Aid](/card/01086) or [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) when you have [Mighty Avengers](/card/21015) down. He'll usually be able to soak up at least one hit or two from the villain for you. Also, don't be afraid to experiment and sub a card for [Ready for Action](/card/04017), which is a <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> you'll be able to recur.\r\n\r\n- You'll be able to get multiple allies out with [Stinger](/card/12014), [Avengers Tower](/card/03024), and [The Triskelion](/card/01073).\r\n_____\r\n\r\n### **_Events:_**\r\n\r\n- [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) is the main ready/heal you're going to be recurring with Wasp's AE-action. Once you have an ally like [Giant-Man](/card/12012), [Goliath](/card/04013), or Power-Man down you'll have some great high-attack turns. [Giant-Man](/card/12012) is your best target, and essentially once you draw one of these, you know you're doing at least 10 damage that turn.\r\n\r\n- [First Aid](/card/01086) is a card you'll use if you just have been unlucky drawing into or recurring your [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) on [Giant-Man](/card/12012). I use [Goliath](/card/23015) to thwart early and he's also an excellent target. U.S. Agent can take multiple hits with this card as well. Don't forget you can use this in alter-ego form.\r\n\r\n- [Ready for Action](/card/04017) has been in this deck and I do really love it for this deck with it being a <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span>. Especially for U.S. Agent, so you keep blocking the villain. Feel free to sub a card and see how you like it.\r\n_________\r\n\r\n### **_Theme!:_**\r\n\r\n- In the spirit of Quantumania, I've tested this deck extensively, especially with Kang Expert and the MODOK modular with smooth sailing.\r\n\r\n- So much theme with [Giant-Man](/card/12012), [Goliath](/card/04013), [Stinger](/card/12014), and [Reinforced Suit](/card/12018)!\r\n_________\r\n\r\n_**I've had a ton of fun with this deck. I love once you're set up,  you have a specific tactic in mind and a recursion mechanic I've always been fond of. You can essentially almost recur you're entire deck and pick the card you need for the right situation. Hope you have fun with this deck if you choose to give it a try!**_\r\n_________\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/listing_xM7CEav.jpg/BROK/resize/1200x1200%3E/format/jpg/quality/70/listing_xM7CEav.jpg\"width=\"400\" height=\"200\">","user_id":2326,"investigator_code":"13001a","investigator_name":"Wasp","slots":{"10030":2,"12011":1,"12012":1,"12014":1,"12018":1,"13002":1,"13003":2,"13004":3,"13005":2,"13006":2,"13007":2,"13008":1,"13009":1,"13010":1,"13020":1,"21012":1,"21015":1,"23012":1,"29027":1,"01072":2,"01073":1,"01086":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"03013":1,"03024":1,"04013":1,"04014":1,"04016":1,"08023":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":26808,"name":"Thor","date_creation":"2023-03-12T02:14:35+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T02:14:35+00:00","description_md":"asdfasdfasdfasdfadfadfasdf","user_id":697,"investigator_code":"06001a","investigator_name":"Thor","slots":{"01050":1,"01051":1,"01053":2,"01055":2,"01057":3,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":3,"05030":3,"06002":1,"06003":3,"06004":1,"06005":3,"06006":2,"06007":1,"06008":2,"06009":1,"06010":1,"06011":1,"06012":1,"06014":2,"06015":2,"06017":1,"06018":3,"06019":1,"06020":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"2.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":""},{"id":26809,"name":"Spider-Man","date_creation":"2023-03-12T02:18:14+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T02:18:14+00:00","description_md":"dsfadsfadfasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","user_id":697,"investigator_code":"01001a","investigator_name":"Spider-Man","slots":{"01002":1,"01003":2,"01004":2,"01005":3,"01006":1,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01075":1,"01076":1,"01077":2,"01078":2,"01079":1,"01080":2,"01081":2,"01082":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":3,"03033":2,"05012":1,"05014":2,"05015":2,"05017":2,"06033":2},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":""},{"id":26810,"name":"Captain America","date_creation":"2023-03-12T02:21:58+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T02:21:58+00:00","description_md":"asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasd","user_id":697,"investigator_code":"03001a","investigator_name":"Captain America","slots":{"01066":1,"01067":1,"01068":1,"01069":2,"01070":2,"01071":2,"01072":2,"01074":1,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":3,"03002":1,"03003":2,"03004":3,"03005":2,"03006":2,"03007":1,"03008":1,"03009":1,"03010":2,"03011":1,"03013":1,"03014":1,"03015":2,"03017":2,"05032":2,"06032":2},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":""},{"id":26812,"name":"Ms. Marvel","date_creation":"2023-03-12T02:28:34+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T02:28:34+00:00","description_md":"asdasdasdfasdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","user_id":697,"investigator_code":"05001a","investigator_name":"Ms. Marvel","slots":{"01058":1,"01059":1,"01060":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01063":3,"01064":3,"01065":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":3,"03032":2,"05002":1,"05003":3,"05004":3,"05005":2,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05008":1,"05009":1,"05010":1,"05011":1,"05031":2,"06031":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":""},{"id":26813,"name":"Ms. Marvel","date_creation":"2023-03-12T02:28:34+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T02:28:34+00:00","description_md":"asdasdasdfasdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","user_id":697,"investigator_code":"05001a","investigator_name":"Ms. Marvel","slots":{"01058":1,"01059":1,"01060":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01063":3,"01064":3,"01065":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":3,"03032":2,"05002":1,"05003":3,"05004":3,"05005":2,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05008":1,"05009":1,"05010":1,"05011":1,"05031":2,"06031":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"2.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":""},{"id":26814,"name":"Ms. Marvel","date_creation":"2023-03-12T02:28:35+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T02:28:35+00:00","description_md":"asdasdasdfasdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa","user_id":697,"investigator_code":"05001a","investigator_name":"Ms. Marvel","slots":{"01058":1,"01059":1,"01060":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01063":3,"01064":3,"01065":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":3,"03032":2,"05002":1,"05003":3,"05004":3,"05005":2,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05008":1,"05009":1,"05010":1,"05011":1,"05031":2,"06031":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"3.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":""},{"id":26815,"name":"Wolverine Aggression","date_creation":"2023-03-12T02:47:42+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T02:47:42+00:00","description_md":"The main idea is to prioritize getting out [Combat Training](/card/01057), [Adamantium Skeleton](/card/35004) and both [Fluid Motion](/card/28016).

Deck niby podobny do poprzedniego Thora, ale w praktyce zupełnie inny, jako że T'Challa jest zupełnie inną postacią. Thor miał dużo problemu z zasobami, małą rękę startową, powoli się rozkręcał itp. Czarna pantera jest jego przeciwieństwem - mamy aż 8 podwójnych zasobów dzięki dodatkowym [Vibranium](/card/01044). W dodatku nie mamy takich problemów z schemami dzięki bazowym 2 Thw wspomaganym z [Tactical Genius](/card/01048). No i leczenie z [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049). To wszystko sprawia, że możemy sobie pozwalić na dużo bardziej wolny i kontrolny styl gry niż w przypadku Thora.\r\n\r\n- Z nowych zabawek z pakietu Thora mamy przede wszystkim [Mean Swing](/card/06015) i [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019). Mean Swing jest o tyle fajny u Black Panther, że jego dwa upgrade czyli [Panther Claws](/card/01047) i [Energy Daggers](/card/01046) to \"weapon\" i to takie, których wyczerpywaniem nie musimy się przejmować. Jarnbjorn jest fajne, bo [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) to taki narzędzie do jego aktywacji. Dodatkowo możemy go wyciągnąć z [Shuri](/card/01041). \r\n\r\n- Z naszymi dodatkowymi zasobami możemy być bardziej chciwi jeśli chodzi o ekonomie stąd [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091) i [Quincarrier](/card/08023) w decku. Nie są to kluczowe karty, ale jeśli akurat siądą jak mamy podwójne zasoby to swoje jak najbardziej robią. Dodatkowo mamy [Enhanced Physique](/card/19033) jako źródło gwarantowanych piąstek do Jarnbjorna. Tu też uwaga - już w następnym pakiecie z [Black Widow](/card/08001a) dostajemy [Quincarrier](/card/08023), więc jeśli mamy go w swoim arsenale to możemy się pozbyć Enhanced physique. \r\n\r\n- Gramy [Tac Team](/card/01056), który osobiście całkiem lubię (a przynajmniej na tym etapie gry). Nie wyciągamy z niego niesamowitego value - za 3 zasoby łącznie 6 obrażeń rozłożonego na 3 tury jest dalekie do ideału. Podobne value robią sojusznicy za 3 z agresji, a mogą posłużyć jeszcze do obrony ataku i mają często dodatkową zdolność jak grani przez nas [Tigra](/card/01051) czy [Valkyrie](/card/06012). To czemu to gramy? Z kilku powodów. Przede wszystkim mamy dużo podwójnych zasobów, a w momencie gdy już mamy nasze upgrady na stole targetów pod nie mamy mniej, więc możemy sobie pozwolić na cięższe rzeczy. Dwa, że tac team bardzo pasuje do naszej mechaniki, tzn. z naszym [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) mało kiedy potrzebujemy dobić miniona za 5, częsciej raczej potrzebujemy coś tam podobijać więc w jego przypadku preferuje Tac team ponad takie rzeczy jak [Relentless Assault](/card/01053). Trzy fajny jest do kończenia gierek. Zostawiamy sobie 1 zasób na ostatnią turę, wtedy 2x aktywacja tac team, 2 sojuszników z 2 atk  już dmg robi się fajny. Tak czy siak to żaden priorytet na stole, dalej większy mają sojusznicy, Tac team zagrywamy po prostu jak jest okazja.\r\n\r\n- Skoro już o sojusznikach mówimy, to gramy ich całkiem sporo.\r\n - Nick fury - dla mnie \"no-brainer\" w taliach w których mamy właśnie dużo podwójnych zasobów. Pozwala nam mielić talie, czyli potencjalnie dobrać kolejne [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a)\r\n - [Hulk](/card/01050) - pamiętajcie, że to jednak nie deck Thora gdzie mocno się nastawialiśmy na piąstki. Tu mamy ich znaaacznie mniej. Przez co używanie jego aktywacji jest no... jak wszystko przy Hulku... mocno kontrowersyjne. Hulk jest bardziej do obrony. Jak wejdzie w połączeniu z [The Power of Aggression](/card/01055) to kosztuje tyle co nic, ma 5 hp, więc ma szanse przyjąć na klatę 2 ataku złola.\r\n - Wspomniany wcześniej duet w postaci [Valkyrie](/card/06012) i [Tigra](/card/01051). Tigra jest szczególnie fajna w tym decku. Z [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) i [Tac Team](/card/01056) setowanie minionów tak by Tigra zadawała im ostatni atak jest bardzo proste, nawet jak miniony mają po te 6 i więcej hp.\r\n - [Lockjaw](/card/05018) nie jest taki kluczowy jak w poprzednich deckach. Są gry gdzie go nawet nie zagramy, ale zawsze czuwa w pogotowiu na wypadek gdybyśmy potrzebowali te dodatkowe 2 pkt w Sch.\r\n - [Mockingbird](/card/01083) na tym etapie stalwart jeszcze nie istnieje więc z tego korzystamy. Stuny z czarną panterą są o tyle fajne, że dają nam dodatkowy czas nanadrobienie HPków z [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049). \r\n\r\n- Ostatnimi kartami o których nie mówiliśmy są [Endurance](/card/05023) i [Combat Training](/card/01057). Endurance jest fajne, bo możemy przyjąć dodatkowy hit złola na klatę, a potem spokojnie się leczyć z [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049) gwarantując sobie z niego pełne value. Combat training jest daleko na naszej liście priorytetów. Gramy Mean Swing co prawda, ale to nie jest tak, że będziemy atakować co turę. Kolejna karta która jest ok do zagrania jak podpasują zasoby, ale nie jest niewiadomo jak ważna.\r\n\r\nI to by było na tyle. W pilotażu mam wrażenie, że jest ciupkę trudniejszy od reszty omawianych decków, trochę dodatkowych decyzji mamy więcej do podjęcia. Zaczynając od wyboru upgradu na start - przeważnie zaczynam od [Tactical Genius](/card/01048) lub [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049), ale to też nie reguła, zależy mocno od scenariusza. Dodatkowo czy lepiej się zbroić od razu, czy wykorzystać [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) do kontroli stołu na początku kosztem poświęcenia/przesunięcia na później kolejnej części pancerza? Druga rzecz to wykorzystywanie naszego basic power. Atakować potrzebujemy jak mamy [Mean Swing](/card/06015) a to i dodatkowo odpalenie [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019). Sch jest fajny, bo Sch zawsze mało w agresji. Def jest fajny, bo lepiej możemy wykorzystać nasze retaliate. Więc troszkę trzeba jednak wyczuć. Czy warto zagrywać [The Golden City](/card/01045), bo możemy sobie pozwolić na zmianę w Alter-ego, czy jednak czujemy, że w danym scenariuszu to jednak zbyt groźne? Trochę tego jest, ale warto się trochę pomęczyć, bo to naprawdę przyjemny deczek jest.","user_id":3231,"investigator_code":"01040a","investigator_name":"Black Panther","slots":{"01041":1,"01042":1,"01043a":1,"01043b":1,"01043c":1,"01043d":2,"01044":3,"01045":1,"01046":1,"01047":1,"01048":1,"01049":1,"01050":1,"01051":1,"01055":2,"01056":3,"01057":1,"01083":1,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"05018":1,"05023":1,"06012":1,"06015":3,"06019":1,"06034":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"solo, beginner"},{"id":26820,"name":"Wolverine","date_creation":"2023-03-12T08:55:20+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T08:55:20+00:00","description_md":"ñoñoñoñoño","user_id":12375,"investigator_code":"35001a","investigator_name":"Wolverine","slots":{"10018":1,"18012":3,"18018":1,"20026":3,"21046":1,"28016":1,"28017":1,"32020":1,"32042":1,"32047":1,"35002":1,"35003":1,"35004":1,"35005":1,"35006":1,"35007":1,"35008":2,"35009":2,"35010":2,"35011":2,"35012":2,"35014":1,"36026":1,"38019":1,"01054":2,"01055":1,"01057":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1,"05030":2,"06017":1,"06019":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"multiplayer"},{"id":26821,"name":"Iron Man TEST KLAW","date_creation":"2023-03-12T10:32:33+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T10:32:33+00:00","description_md":"ASDSADASFASFASF","user_id":12697,"investigator_code":"01029a","investigator_name":"Iron Man","slots":{"01030":1,"01031":3,"01032":2,"01033":1,"01034":1,"01035":1,"01036":1,"01037":1,"01038":2,"01039":2,"01058":1,"01059":1,"01060":3,"01061":2,"01062":2,"01063":3,"01064":1,"01065":1,"01083":1,"01084":1,"01085":2,"01087":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":""},{"id":26822,"name":"Ironheart -SCL s14 r2","date_creation":"2023-03-12T11:04:32+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T11:04:32+00:00","description_md":"testing deck for the SCL S14 r2","user_id":30553,"investigator_code":"29001a","investigator_name":"Ironheart","slots":{"28018":1,"29004":1,"29005":2,"29006":3,"29007":2,"29008":1,"29009":2,"29010":1,"29011":1,"29012":1,"29013":1,"29015":1,"29016":1,"29017":3,"29018":1,"29023":1,"29025":1,"29027":1,"32019":1,"33011":1,"36015":1,"01067":1,"01072":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1,"04017":2,"08024":1,"08031":2},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":""},{"id":26823,"name":"Yee1","date_creation":"2023-03-12T12:24:01+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-12T12:24:01+00:00","description_md":"This is just a test deck.","user_id":31825,"investigator_code":"12001a","investigator_name":"Ant-Man","slots":{"12002":1,"12003":2,"12004":1,"12005":2,"12006":2,"12007":3,"12008":1,"12009":2,"12010":1,"12011":1,"12013":1,"12015":2,"12017":2,"12018":2,"21015":1,"01066":1,"01072":2,"01086":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"03013":1,"03014":1,"03015":2,"03024":1,"04012":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":""},{"id":26824,"name":"SP//dr Suit Leadership vs Risky Business, SCL S14R02","date_creation":"2023-03-12T12:37:17+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-22T04:04:19+00:00","description_md":"Round 2 - Risky Business + Wrecking Crew (03/05/23-3/18/23)\r\n\r\nDifficulty: Standard II\r\n\r\nHero: \r\n\r\n  - Champions: Ironheart, Nova, or Ms. Marvel\r\n\r\n  - Guardians: Gamora, Nebula, or Star-Lord\r\n\r\n  - Web-Warriors: Ghost-Spider, SP//dr, or Spider-Ham\r\n\r\n  - X-Men: Colossus, Cyclops, or Storm\r\n\r\nAspect: Leadership\r\n\r\nDeck-Building Constraints:  No cards with \"Avenger\" trait.

Oh [Shrink](/card/05011) pumps [Even the Odds](/card/30014)... Oh [Ms. Marvel](/card/05001a) can recur it to hand every turn if needed.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a solo deck.  You will depend on teammates to maintain the board while you build up to the combo turn.\r\n\r\n## GAME PLAN:\r\n\r\n### [One Way or Another](/card/22015)\r\n\r\nWe recur this as much as we are comfortable to build up a big board of Side Schemes, while using the draw to get out [Overwatch](/card/30019), [Followed](/card/03032), [Sense of Justice](/card/14030), [Biokinetic Polymer Suit](/card/05009), & most importantly [Shrink](/card/05011)\r\n\r\n### [Even the Odds](/card/30014)\r\n\r\nand to a lesser extent [Multitasking](/card/15013) to soften up the side schemes.  Use [Passion for Justice](/card/34020) & [Shrink](/card/05011) to make big Thwarts.  Trigger a bunch of upgrades. \r\n\r\n### When to go off?\r\n\r\nI'd wait for 3 side schemes and to have [Followed](/card/03032) and [Overwatch](/card/30019) on all three.  You will trigger for 3 x 4 damage ([Followed](/card/03032)) and 3 damage ([Even the Odds](/card/30014)).  Overwatch is variable but these will help you get the Main Scheme down if you had any issues due to Patrol or Crisis Icons.  You can certainly go off with more than 3 but, I would want to keep Side Schemes in for rebuilding to do it again.\r\n\r\nRULES NOTE: Sadly [Embiggen!](/card/05010) doesn't work with [Even the Odds](/card/30014).\r\n\r\n### Allies\r\n\r\n[Wasp](/card/29034) is the the mainly there because of Crisis Icons that are likely to be on Side Schemes.  [Jessica Jones](/card/01059) is there to keep the main under control with buffs from the side schemes we're leaving out. [Quake](/card/08012) is cheap and an <span class=\"icon-energy\"></span>.  [Quasar](/card/21047) can help you set-up for the big turn.\r\n\r\n### FLEXIBLE SPOTS:\r\n\r\n[One Way or Another](/card/22015) #3 - With [Ms. Marvel](/card/05001a) being above to recur the event, you should only ever need one.  However, you want to get the 1st as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### ALTERNATE CONSIDERATIONS:\r\n\r\n[Spider-Man](/card/04045) - We aren't looking to clear side schemes early but there are some scenarios with huge side schemes where I'd consider him.  He also costs 5 in a deck that only has the basic resources to assist in paying for him\r\n\r\n[Eros](/card/22011) - Is cheap with a decent THW.  If you need to defend more then this is good for that.\r\n\r\n[Wraith](/card/22012) - I love Wraith as tech against annoying boosts.  Doesn't fit the theme but worth a consider.  \r\n\r\n[Even the Odds](/card/30014) #3 - You really don't need a full 3 of this card with all of the card draw off of [One Way or Another](/card/22015) and the potential to stash them with [Bruno Carrelli](/card/05007).\r\n\r\n[Skilled Investigator](/card/04047) - It is not quite the engine it is in other decks since we want to clear multiple schemes in one turn instead of 1 per turn.\r\n\r\nMore [Operative Skill](/card/37013) - May be worth running more but you can only have 1 in play at a time and you should get to it when you're running [One Way or Another](/card/22015) every turn.","user_id":26151,"investigator_code":"05001a","investigator_name":"Ms. Marvel","slots":{"14030":1,"15013":3,"21047":1,"22015":3,"29034":1,"30014":2,"30019":3,"34020":2,"37013":1,"01059":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"03032":3,"05002":1,"05003":3,"05004":3,"05005":2,"05006":1,"05007":1,"05008":1,"05009":1,"05010":1,"05011":1,"08012":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":""},{"id":26852,"name":"Theoretically Infinite","date_creation":"2023-03-13T17:00:30+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-13T17:03:42+00:00","description_md":"One of my friends and I love to theory craft and we got to thinking about if or how it is possible to have an infinite turn in marvel champions. Here is one of them. I'd like to note that none of these decks are practical. At the very least, the villain is very likely going to be defeated before you get to the point where you have everything set up to have an infinite turn. Anyway, here's how to go infinite with [Doctor Strange](/card/09001a):\r\n\r\n1. Get EVERY \"permanent\" into play. \"Permanent\" as in all allies, supports, and upgrades.\r\n\r\n2. Draw 6 cards for your turn.\r\n\r\n3. Draw another with [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091).\r\n\r\n4. Play [Master of the Mystic Arts](/card/09005) with [Helicarrier](/card/01092) on [Winds of Watoomb](/card/09036) to draw 3.\r\n\r\n5. Repeat step 4 with [Quincarrier](/card/08023).\r\n\r\n6. Use Dr. Strange's hero ability to draw another 3. \r\n\r\n7. So at this point we have 6 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 16 cards in our hand out of 16 cards in our deck (13 events and 3 resources). At this point (and there are other ways to get here too, like using [Cosmo](/card/17020)/[Wong](/card/09002) + [Sky Cycle](/card/04015) draw more) you can infinitely spam [Spiritual Meditation](/card/15019).

No hay más pasos.\r\n\r\nEl problema de Hulk\r\nHulk su problema es que no tiene sinergia alguna. Por no tener, no tiene una habilidad que le beneficie y su alto Atq y Def ya están equilibrados con el comeback de tener Int 0.\r\n\r\nAsi que lo único explotable son los altos stats de Atq y Def.

I participated in a challenge recently to make a deck using [Even the Odds](/card/30014) which seems like a really fun card but often isn't worth the payoff.\r\n\r\nEnter the Wasp. \r\n\r\n**The Mission:** Use Wasp's *Small But Mighty* ability to tee up extra villain damage. See if you can take down the villain without attacking using some justice shenanigans. If you like this deck you can also check out the [Vision](/card/26001b) variant (https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/26874/pacifist-vision-combo-deck-1.0).\r\n\r\n**The Set-Up:** On your first deckpass you need to focus on setting up your big game winning combo. \r\n- Hack into the villains deck with [One Way or Another](/card/22015) to get 3 + side schemes into play. \r\n- Leave some malware for the villain with upgrades that boost the defeat of these side schemes like [Followed](/card/03032), [Chance Encounter](/card/26034), and [Skilled Investigator](/card/04047).\r\n- Line up the defeat of these side schemes using Wasp's Giant Form - spreading thwart around to set them up all to defeat at once.\r\n\r\n**The Combo:**\r\n- Play [Even the Odds](/card/30014) to defeat 3+ side schemes and sting the villain with your small pings add up to 18+ damage!\r\n- 3 damage from even the odds\r\n- 3 damage from Small but mighty\r\n- 12 damage from 3 copies of [Followed](/card/03032)\r\n- Plus you can go and find 3 allies and a card draw from [Skilled Investigator](/card/04047)!\r\n\r\n**Card Choices:** Every card in this deck is here to help us complete the mission.\r\n- [Vivian](/card/26003) can blank problematic side schemes and be recurred into you deck in a pinch.\r\n- [Jack Flag](/card/20011) and [Wiccan](/card/15011) provide more non-attack damage to throw at the villain.\r\n- [Quasar](/card/21047) can help set up your combo while [Jessica Jones](/card/01059) can hold down the main scheme while you leave those pesky side schemes in the way.\r\n- I choose to include one copy of [Operative Skill](/card/37013) and one copy of [Overwatch](/card/30019) but you could up yourself to 2x [Operative Skill](/card/37013) to boost your even the

The Basic cards provide some card draw, healing and resource generation.\r\n\r\nStrategy:\r\n- Use Spider-Man’s ability to draw a card whenever the villain initiates an attack against you.\r\n\r\n- Use Web-Shooters to generate Wild resources for your Justice cards.\r\n\r\n- Use Backflip to avoid taking damage from the villain’s attack.\r\n\r\n- Use For Justice!, Clear the Area and Counterintelligence to remove threat from the main scheme and side schemes.\r\n\r\n- Use Interrogation Room and Under Surveillance to slow down the villain’s scheme progress.\r\n\r\n- Use Concussive Blow, Spider-Tracer and Webbed Up to stun, confuse and immobilize the villain.\r\n\r\n- Use Enhanced Spider-Sense, Great Responsibility and The Power of Justice to cancel or reduce encounter cards effects.\r\n\r\n- Use Aunt May, First Aid and Med Team to heal yourself or your allies.\r\n\r\n- Use Avengers Mansion, Helicarrier and Quincarrier to draw more cards and reduce the cost of your cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecklist:\r\n\r\n{\"decklist\": [\"01001\", \"01002\", \"01003\", \"01004\", \"01005\", \"01006\", \"01007\", \"01008\", \"01009\", \"01010\", \"01011\", \"01012\", \"01013\", \"01014\", \"01015\", \"02001\", \"02002\", \"02003\", \"02004\", \"02005\", \"02006\", \"02007\", \"02008\", \"02009\", \"02010\", \"02011\", \"02012\", \"02013\", \"02014\", \"02015\", \"00001\", \"00002\", \"00003\", \"00004\", \"00005\", \"00006\", \"00007\", \"00008\", \"00009\", \"00010\"]}\r\n\r\n\r\n**>Please include the name of the card for each decklist entry.**\r\n\r\nSure, I can include the name of the card for each decklist entry.

I don't even know how to link the cards in the text here. :-) \r\n\r\nWhen I bought SP//dr, the level of apparent complication in the deck really called to me as something that could be a really great engine to build on, but she had what I call the Hawkeye problem; the identity deck doesn't really lean into one aspect more than the others. I just wanted a general deck that made her... better at the things she was already doing. \r\n\r\nThen along came All Systems Go All Out.\r\n\r\nI cannot give the original author enough credit for this deck, which is pretty obviously just a stripped down and edited version of that deck. There were a lot of Web Warrior and Spider-Verse cards in it that, on my playthroughs, seemed to get in the way of the heart of what the deck was trying to accomplish. The idea was to boost yourself up a lot, throw out a [Go All Out](/card/29017) or [Push Ahead](/card/29018), then re-ready and exhaust whichever Interface card was appropriate for easy double-digit thwart or damage in one turn, on top of whatever you were doing with your other cards.\r\n\r\nI feel like any kind of tactical walkthrough would just be a beginner's course in how to play SP//dr; hard mulligan for [All Systems Go!](/card/31004), [Host Spider](/card/31010) or [Aunt May & Uncle Ben](/card/31007), then build the resource and boost engine as fast as possible for big swings and killer plays. Throw Ven#m out when you can boost her to being a 5 Att and 5 Thwart for no additional cards from your hand. As always, SP//dr fears no kicker as she can generate most whatever resource she needs to at any given time with her Pilot Interface. And obviously if things get too hairy, she has the unique ability to attack or thwart (twice, even) in the same round that she recovers because of her split identity card.\r\n\r\nIt's a great deck. The only things I'm not 100% satisfied with are First Aid and Target Acquired; these are situationally very useful in a pinch to either get some extra pinch healing or cancel a terrible boost card, respectively, but the former comes up rarely with her built in recovery and may be better served with something like one copy of Downtime. And honestly the most fun element to me is that when the board is all set up and I'm rotating cards and sliding things around and playing them, it feels like I'm manipulating the controls of a mecha (dials, levers and buttons, respectively).\r\n\r\nBut yeah. I've had an incredible success rate with her and wanted to share the joy. Let me know what you think, and especially if you have suggestions to replace First Aid and Target Acquired with something else.","user_id":29726,"investigator_code":"31001a","investigator_name":"SP//dr Suit","slots":{"19032":3,"21017":3,"29017":3,"29018":3,"31003":1,"31004":3,"31005":2,"31006":2,"31007":1,"31008":1,"31009":1,"31010":1,"31011":1,"31012":1,"31013":1,"31024":1,"33017":3,"01086":3,"05032":3,"08024":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"solo, theme"},{"id":26905,"name":"Wolverine & The X-Men with SHIELD Tactical Support","date_creation":"2023-03-15T03:28:17+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-15T05:10:10+00:00","description_md":"I'm a new player to the game and now that I've had some time to get myself familiar with the cards I wanted to see what people thought of one of my first deck builds.\r\n\r\nWhen I started to feel comfortable enough with the cards to start building my own decks I was really motivated to put them together in a way that would represent something I would like to see in the actual comics.

While building out, you play the ally’s as you can over your attack cards to be able to handle the thwarting and take down minions. \r\n\r\nFlip to alter-ego often, almost every turn, so you can get the benefits of doing so. \r\n\r\nPlaying this deck I went through the scenario taking 0 damage, clearing all threat, and defeating the villain in 6/7/10 turns. \r\n\r\nColossus is a beast!","user_id":22787,"investigator_code":"32001a","investigator_name":"Colossus","slots":{"16024":1,"32002":1,"32003":1,"32004":1,"32005":1,"32006":2,"32007":2,"32008":3,"32009":2,"32010":2,"32019":1,"32049":1,"33011":1,"33015":3,"33019":1,"33020":1,"33021":1,"36015":1,"36016":1,"36017":1,"36018":1,"36020":3,"36022":1,"38018":1,"01072":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"04016":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"solo, theme, beginner"},{"id":26917,"name":"X-Men, Dancing with the Star(Lord)s","date_creation":"2023-03-15T14:17:26+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-16T16:26:05+00:00","description_md":"<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LHm3cek.png\" alt=\"3-Card Monte\" style=\"width:350px;height:225px;\"> \r\n<p><em>This show only lasted one season. </em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello everyone! Star-Lord has made a real 180 in interest for me over the past year. I think having other teams/tribals enter the game has just made him more interesting, sharing his Gaurdian trait easily with teams that bring their own strengths.\r\n\r\nThis deck aims to reliably setup some of the best thwarting allies in the game, fielding a team of X-Men Allies with Mission Training and a board wide boost from Leader of the Gaurdians.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Stars </strong><p/>\r\nWe're using a suite of effective allies that we actively want to play with with What Could Go Wrong?, and get the most out of our buffing effects. Banshee can give us an added bonus when he thwarts, Blindfolds affect works well with Star-Lord in particular, Dazzler gives a valuable confuse on play, and Marvel Girl has the best Thwart:Health:Cost ratio for our X-Men allies, with a situationally positive affect.\r\n\r\nWe won't be buffing Professor-X but his three Thwart+Confuse+Chump block is too much to not include, with some additional utility that's nice to have in the back pocket. Mockingbird and Gamora are also just super valuable to bring out with our ability and are some of the best Tempo and Value allies respectively for their cost.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Show </strong><p/>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe premise is Simple, Leader of the Gaurdians and a Mission Training can setup an ally to singlehandedly manage a whole players worth of threat by themselves for several turns. Blindfold is our worst target for this and even she will manage 16 Threat by herself when things are said and done. Danger Room will let us get this set-up consistently and make repeating it effortless. X-Mansion can also keep spinning value out of an ally if we wish to focus on developing something else.\r\n\r\nWe're bringing Sonic Rifles(carried in a side holster), as we'll have an easier time playing them than most other heroes and they'll let us flip down to utilize our powerful supports more. This will also enable Meditation. We like this a lot more than Power of Justice or Basic, since it can hit targets for both of those as well has our hero specific cards. The alter-ego restriction is not an issue since we're doing it anyway to use our supports and have ample confuse, plus we're not reliant on our basic activation to progress our gameplan.\r\n\r\nOur ample Thwarting also makes cards like One Way or Another and Command Center much more accessible and easier, and are nice rewards for doing our jobs well.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Script </strong><p/>\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about this list is the small amount of setup you need. We really just want to hard mulligan for Leader of the Guardians and Danger Room. Danger Room becomes less of a priority the more aggressive you expect the villain's early game to be, as we'll possibly want to chump block before setup is completed. We can always hard play Training upgrades on our allies, but Danger Room does represent value and consistency that should not be overlooked. \r\n\r\nAlso, we want to make sure we setup at least one Element Gun from our opener. 5-damage (2 from our activation and 3 from a gun) is going to be enough to handle most damage demands until we reach setup, especially if we give ourselves an extra turn for damage from a Banshee activation confusing a minion. Command Center also helps solve these problems cleanly, but since it's dependent on actually having a side scheme in play for our stellar allies to defeat, we don't want to miss out on guaranteed damage. \r\n\r\nPost-setup, we are not going to have much issue getting into alter-ego to quickly equip an X-Men ally. Playing an ally in Alter-Ego may seem awkward, but we have so much Thwart that we won't miss anything dropped there. We're also just as likely to start in AE so getting the full boost from the get go is very feasible. \r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Side-Deck </strong><p/>\r\nOverwatch might seem like a obvious include here, but our Thwart is just high enough that it generally isn't necessary even in a two-player game. For going up in player count or playing against a Villian which starts with more Threat/side-schemes I think you can justify it. Game Time falls under a very similar umbrella. We are already Thwarting enough, but if we notice more burst Thwarting is needed it might be wanted.\r\n\r\nThink Fast! is also a very potent card, though I didn't like how it could conflict with the on play affects of allies we wanted to hit the table, so that's why the Sonic Rifles were brought in as a more on-demand option. If you're in a fast paced solo game or with a team where no one else is confusing then you can find room for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest of luck, and I hope anyone who plays this list enjoys!","user_id":14632,"investigator_code":"17001a","investigator_name":"Star-Lord","slots":{"17002":1,"17003":3,"17004":2,"17005":3,"17006":1,"17007":2,"17008":1,"17009":1,"17010":1,"19020":1,"20015":2,"20021":1,"22015":3,"26036":3,"32019":1,"32049":1,"33014":1,"33021":1,"34014":1,"34015":1,"34016":3,"35032":1,"37012":1,"01083":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer"},{"id":26918,"name":"I have balls of steel","date_creation":"2023-03-15T16:34:30+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-18T20:04:25+00:00","description_md":"Additions: Moira + Mutant Education.\r\nColossus way to play is always ending the turn on AE and back to hero with Armor Up.

You're always going to be happy to see this one. Hope the mere sight of her has you [Inspired](/card/01074), because villains (and their minions) beware when you put your [Leadership Skill](/card/36019) to the test on this one. You also might find yourself suddenly in possession of a [Med Lab](/card/38028) or [Quincarrier](/card/08023) or some other goodies. Just...don't ask where the funding comes from.\r\n<br>\r\n<B>The Ghost-Spider Beach</b>\r\n<br>Access to this beach can be restricted unless you got your [Warrior of the Great Web](/card/30029) ticket at the ready or own yourself a nice [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023). Let's be real though, you have to be ready to [Make the Call](/card/01071) to access this beach and that's fine because once there, you will soon be pulling your [Backflip](/card/01003)s, [Swinging Web Kick](/card/01005)s and that [Enhanced Spider-Sense](/card/01004) will definitely be up for some tingling too.\r\n<br>\r\n<B>The Ironheart Beach</b>\r\n<br>This beach is pretty straightforward. Sometimes gets found by the [Black Cat](/card/01002) beach, which is good. It's a solid beach that provides you with all the things you want from a beach: easy to access, able to provide you with more resources and you're never going to be unhappy to just run this beach out.\r\n<br>\r\n<B>The Maria Hill Beach</b>\r\n<br>If you wanna throw a party, this is where to do it. Everyone will be happy to see this beach. For some reason, this beach seems to always be in need of some kind of [Rapid Response](/card/08031), but that's alright because if you pull that one off, this will make everyone happy! Same if you decide to [Make the Call](/card/01071) for this beach.\r\n<br>\r\n<B>The Mockingbird Beach</b>\r\n<br>Ah, a classic. Not great for those pesky steady and stalwart types, but you're likely to get some enjoyment out of this stunning beach. Given its healthy rating, it's a great beach to feel [Inspired](/card/01074) by. Just don't tell Nick Fury we're borrowing this beach.\r\n<br>\r\n<B>The SP//dr Beach</b>\r\n<br>Like the Ghost-Spider beach, this beach might initially be restricted in access. Once you've got access though, the recurring nature of this beach gets you quite a bit of mileage and you will absolutely love this beach once you got yourself that [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023).\r\n<br>\r\n<B>The Stinger Beach</b>\r\n<br>This beach is tiny. So tiny, you won't even notice the beach is there! That being said, this beach benefits from a display of your [Leadership Skill](/card/36019). Despite it's small size, this beach gives you the breathing room you need at times to get that well earned R&R.\r\n<br>\r\n<B>The White Tiger Beach</b>\r\n<br>The nastier the villains get, the better this beach becomes! Early on, this beach almost pays for itself and in the later stages, you're just really happy to see this beach. Doesn't do well with [Rapid Response](/card/08031)s or when you [Make the Call](/card/01071), but that's alright as we've got our [Med Lab](/card/38028) specifically for this beach.\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Spidey's Lifeguard Class 101</h3>\r\nWe've got several tools to make good use of our beaches. First and foremost, let's highlight our [Med Lab](/card/38028). As mentioned before, The White Tiger beach makes excellent use of this facility. Combined with being somewhat of a scientist myself, [Ingenuity](/card/29027), our handy dandy [Web-Shooter](/card/01008)s and the [Quincarrier](/card/08023), every time we have some down time while we access the [Med Lab](/card/38028), we're going to have a great time keeping our beaches fresh like an ocean breeze.\r\n\r\nWe really hope to get to see that great [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023) once we've officially become a [Warrior of the Great Web](/card/30029), but it if we have the resources to spare and have not visited the [Ghost-Spider](/card/27048) beach or the [SP//dr](/card/30021) beach yet, we may want to consider it because of how good it will be.\r\n\r\nBeing able to [Rapid Response](/card/08031) any of the beaches is going to be good, but I doubt you needed me to tell you that.\r\n\r\n[Leadership Skill](/card/36019) is really good, because you can spread its use out across the beaches when and where you need to. Unfortunately, you can have only one display of your [Leadership Skill](/card/36019)s out, but it works in tandem with that [Inspired](/card/01074) [Black Cat](/card/01002) beach.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's good to remember that it's not the lifeguard's duty to protect the beach, but to make sure no one drowns in the sea of villainy.\r\n___________________________________________________\r\nHope you enjoyed reading this!\r\nThe idea of \"'Beaches' love Spider-Man\" came to me and I felt like I had to make a deck that revolves around that. It's honestly not an amazing/spectacular deck as is, but sometimes it's good to remember that building things around a theme and having fun with it is just as important as trying to come up with the most effective strategies.\r\n\r\nLeadership Spidey works pretty damn well in general, as Spider-Sense triggers before you declare an ally as a potential blocker. [Rapid Response](/card/08031) and [Make the Call](/card/01071) having a printed <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> resource means [Black Cat](/card/01002) can draw you into them as well, which is just awesome.","user_id":29955,"investigator_code":"01001a","investigator_name":"Spider-Man","slots":{"12014":1,"13018":1,"21013":1,"27023":1,"27048":1,"29027":1,"30021":1,"30029":1,"36019":2,"38028":1,"01002":1,"01003":2,"01004":2,"01005":3,"01006":1,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01067":1,"01071":3,"01074":3,"01083":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"08023":1,"08031":2},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":26922,"name":"Honed TechNova","date_creation":"2023-03-15T22:00:33+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-15T22:00:33+00:00","description_md":"I really enjoyed playing this deck through the RoRS campaign box with another player playing an Iron Heart Justice deck. \r\n\r\nThis deck works really well against small minions, big minions, huge villains, and with [Unleash Nova Force](/card/28006)you can do some crazy things with [Dive Bomb](/card/17028)!","user_id":22248,"investigator_code":"28001a","investigator_name":"Nova","slots":{"10018":1,"16040":1,"17028":3,"28002":1,"28003":2,"28004":3,"28005":3,"28006":2,"28007":2,"28008":1,"28009":1,"28010":1,"28012":2,"28017":2,"32047":2,"35013":1,"35014":1,"35018":2,"01054":3,"01055":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"05023":1,"06019":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"multiplayer, theme"},{"id":26923,"name":"Multiplayer Ironheart","date_creation":"2023-03-15T22:08:00+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-15T22:08:00+00:00","description_md":"Loved this deck for two player MC.

Pues aquí probando otro de los mazos candidatos a llevarme a Board Game Fest. Y en este caso he querido tirar de una Viuda con arquetipo S.H.I.E.L.D pero versión lite. En sus primeras iteraciones era una versión completa del arquetipo con ella, pero me di cuenta que en ciertos escenarios exigentes de amenaza, montar toda la maquinaria S.H.I.E.L.D supone un tiempo que no siempre te puedes permitir perder. Por eso en este mazo he intentado mantener la esencia pero siendo un poco más proactivos quitando amenaza.\r\n\r\nSi nos centramos en las cartas S.H.I.E.L.D, podemos ver que los objetivos _factibles_ para [Intervención de S.H.I.E.L.D.](/card/27042) son las tres copias de [Equipo de vigilancia](/card/01064), las 2 de [Agente sobre el terreno](/card/27044), y los aliados con 1 de intervención, que en este caso son [Temblor](/card/08012) y [Monica Chang](/card/27040), que es al final la que te busca los Equipo de vigilancia. Si te encuentras en héroe varios turnos seguidos (que suele ser raro con este tipo de mazos), [Piso franco n.º 29](/card/08005) puede ser objetivo válido para intervenir. La propia Viuda en alter ego, si no necesitamos curarnos, también puede sacarnos de un aprieto. En casos muy desesperado y solo si tienes a [Agente 13](/card/03002) o literalmente nada más que hacer con él, el [Helitransporte](/card/01092) también es válido. Por tanto tenemos 7 objetivos preferentes, 2 situacionales y 1 de emergencias. \r\n\r\nEntonces, al tener menos objetivos para intervenir con [Intervención de S.H.I.E.L.D.](/card/27042), necesitamos paliar un poco la amenaza por otro lado, que puede ser suficiente o no dependiendo del escenario. De las cartas que han venido con Gambito, [Breaking and Entering](/card/37015) y [Operative Skill](/card/37013) pueden darnos ese extra de quitar amenaza, ya que ambos pueden usarse en alter ego y habrá que priorizar más que en otros mazos [Operación encubierta](/card/08003).\r\n\r\nHe estado dudando sobre que preparaciones meter y al final me he decidido por [Contraespionaje](/card/08017), para cubrir aún más el tema de la amenaza; y [Tácticas de infiltración](/card/08018) para control de cartas de encuentro. Ambas son Interrupción, a diferencia de [Objetivo fijado](/card/08024) que había metido inicialmente,que es Respuesta **de héroe**, lo que facilita su uso aunque no se active la pasiva de Viuda Negra. El número de copias de ambas cartas varíara dependiendo de la exigencia del escenario en quitar amenaza (3-1) o evitar cartas de encuentro (2-2 o 1-3). \r\n\r\nRespecto a los recursos, creo que funciona bien tal como está pero se podría discutir si quitar una copia de [El poder de todos unidos](/card/13024) por una copia de [El poder de la justicia](/card/01062) o incluso quitarla simplemente. Todo esto depende de que cartas termines dandole más uso, aunque si que es verdad que creo que hay mucha más carta de Justicia que entra y sale constantemente que de las básicas, lo que le va a dar más salida al recurso de aspecto. \r\n\r\nProblema principal de este mazo (y la Viuda Justicia en general) y razón por la que creo que funciona mejor a multi: Es un mazo bastante egoísta y tienes carencias grandisimas en cuanto a infligir daño a los enemigos. Dependes mucho de activar con frecuencia tus preparaciones en héroe y tus tres unicas copias de ataque, así como los aliados. Me he enfretado a Mojo con él y he ganado con las justas (en Normal, como persona decente que soy), usando a Agente 13 para atacar de 1 en varios casos. En escenarios con más planes secundarios, se puede plantear meter el [Centro de mando](/card/35032) o [Seguimiento](/card/03032), pero creo que definitivamente no es un mazo de meterte en escenarios con mucho esbirro o que no tengas a alguien con Agresivdad cubriendote el daño.\r\n\r\nBueno, ya teneis aquí otra opinión de alguien que no tiene demasiada idea, pero le gusta hablarlo mucho. ¡Un saludo y mover ficha para todos!

At least 3 cards with or requiring your faction trait.\r\n\r\nFinished in 5, 7 and 5 turns with a [Dark Dealings](/card/24050) that took me to 6 threat on the main scheme in the first game (one of those times that [Total Annihilation](/card/24054) is a welcome boost card), clean boards and above maximum health. Double [Lightning Bolt](/card/02044) for the win in game 3.\r\n\r\nI built the deck around building out the board for the first few turns, flipping frequently, and having a lot of ways to keep the hero + ally health high for the end game. \r\n\r\nThe deck was initially inspired by [NormalModeGuy](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/24390/storm-leader-of-the-x-men-v2-0-2.0)'s deck with 3x [Teamwork](/card/06032), but I later realized that this card's primary purpose was saving one or two consequential damage for one effective resource and some restrictions, and I had far better ways to

go up in my estimation quite a bit as I seemed to frequently have a minion out so being able to do 6 spread out damage and activate a special was reasonably efficient. \r\n* All games finished before

out.","user_id":1994,"investigator_code":"36001a","investigator_name":"Storm","slots":{"12024":1,"16024":1,"20029":1,"32019":1,"32020":1,"32048":1,"33011":1,"33015":1,"33019":1,"33020":1,"36006":1,"36007":1,"36008":1,"36009":3,"36010":3,"36011":2,"36012":2,"36013":2,"36015":1,"36016":1,"36017":1,"36018":2,"36022":1,"37021":2,"01071":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"03017":2,"05023":2,"05033":1,"08024":1,"08031":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"solo"},{"id":26945,"name":"Spider-Sham","date_creation":"2023-03-16T15:29:23+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-16T15:29:23+00:00","description_md":"spider

is a very strong defensive hero thanks to her Mass form. To get the most out of her kit, you want to be able to manipulate her forms efficiently and that makes her a fun hero to play! Generally try to always end Hero phase in Phased form. The easiest way to do this is to plan your attacks and flip to Phased after the last attack you play *(note that flipping to Solid is forced but flipping to Phased is not)*. \r\n\r\nAnother important mechanic to know is playing a defense event lets you \"get aggro\" (be the attack target) when the enemy is attacking another player. This lets you defend for another player even after you're exhausted.\r\n\r\n#### **Combos**\r\n 1. *Basic defense (P>S) > [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) (S>P)*: defend against 1 attack and puts you back to Phased. Useful to continue defending or setup [Airwalk](/card/32039)/[Phase Strike](/card/32038).\r\n 2. *[Defiance](/card/26018)/[Jump Flip](/card/27014) (P>S) > [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) (S>P)*: same as #1 if you're the 1st attack target while letting you be ready to use basic defense/thwart/attack.\r\n 3. *#1 > [Quick Shift](/card/32040)/[Preemptive Strike](/card/05014) (P>S)*:  defend against 2nd attack.\r\n 4. *#1 > [Defiance](/card/26018)/[Jump Flip](/card/27014) (P>S)*: defend against 2nd attack if you're the attack target.\r\n 5. *#1 > [Ready to Rumble](/card/32051)*: gives versatility in the follow-up since you can defend against 2nd attack or basic thwart while Phased for [Intangible Interference](/card/32035).\r\n 6. *Basic defense (P>S) > [Powerful Punch](/card/32014) (S>P>S)*: defend against 2 attacks. Since [Powerful Punch](/card/32014) is both an attack and defense, playing it while Solid will flip you to Phased (b/c you attacked) and get aggro (b/c you also defended). While defending, the flip back to Solid is delayed until after the attack is over.\r\n 7. *Basic defense (P>S) > [Quick Shift](/card/32040) (S>P>S)*: defend against 2 attacks. [Quick Shift](/card/32040) will flip you back to Phased (card effect) and get aggro (b/c you also defended). Then you'd flip back to Solid after the attack is over.\r\n 8. *[Quick Shift](/card/32040) (P>S) > [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) (S>P) > basic defense (P>S)*: draw 2 cards while defending against 2 attacks.\r\n\r\n#### **Card Choices**\r\n\r\n * [Counter-Punch](/card/01077): lets you flip back to Phased after defending.\r\n * [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014): lets you defend any player without using a basic defense but has a risk of not being playable if there's 0 boost icon revealed. \r\n * [Defiance](/card/26018): lets you defend when you're getting attacked without using a basic defense.\r\n * [Jump Flip](/card/27014): like [Defiance](/card/26018) and also lets you trigger [Intangible Interference](/card/32035) as you'll be Phased when it resolves.\r\n * [Powerful Punch](/card/32014): lets you change form and defend with just one card. You want to play this when you're Solid and since this is the case, you can use Solid to pay for its cost.\r\n * [Jocasta](/card/26013): 4 thwart and gets back your [Powerful Punch](/card/32014)/[Quick Shift](/card/32040).\r\n * [Ready to Rumble](/card/21022): flipping between Solid/Phased meets the requirement to trigger this so this lets you ready up to use another basic defense or save it for a basic thwart/attack. This is better than [Indomitable](/card/01082) because it's usable in the hero phase.\r\n * [Plan B](/card/27024): with the way the turn structure works, there's a good chance you'll have a card or two laying around before the hero phase ends and this lets you convert that to more damage before you re-draw.\r\n * [Deft Focus](/card/16024): most of your hero specific cards are Superpowers (except [Lockheed](/card/32032), [Kitty's Room](/card/32033), and [Phased and Confused](/card/32036)).\r\n\r\n#### **Cards not included**\r\n * [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017): with the timing of things, this will never get to ignore crisis and trigger [Intangible Interference](/card/32035) unless you take damage (ending with Phased after the attack ends). It's also only limited to the main scheme.\r\n * [Not Today!](/card/38016)/[Expert Defense](/card/03033)/[Never Back Down](/card/14014)/[Desperate Defense](/card/09015): defense events that only works *after* you're defending isn't very efficient since ideally you want to play defense events after you're exhausted. [Never Back Down](/card/14014)/[Desperate Defense](/card/09015) allows for an extra ready but isn't as efficient as [Ready to Rumble](/card/21022) since you can't just leave it in play.\r\n * [Side Step](/card/14015): similar function to [Jump Flip](/card/27014) but removing 2 threat is often more valuable than doing 1 damage.\r\n * [Warning](/card/09021): was errata'd to no longer be a defense.\r\n * [X-Gene](/card/38019): the cards this can affect compared to [Deft Focus](/card/16024) doesn't overcome the fact that you'd have to be in alter-ego to play it making this awkward to play if you draw it after turn 1.","user_id":14718,"investigator_code":"32030a","investigator_name":"Shadowcat","slots":{"10031":1,"14017":1,"16024":1,"26013":1,"26016":1,"26018":3,"27014":3,"27024":1,"32014":3,"32018":2,"32032":1,"32033":1,"32034":1,"32035":1,"32036":2,"32037":3,"32038":2,"32039":2,"32040":2,"32051":1,"01077":3,"05014":3,"09020":1,"32031a":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer"},{"id":26952,"name":"Gambit Aggression - Mojo","date_creation":"2023-03-16T19:07:16+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-16T19:07:16+00:00","description_md":"Gambit Aggression - Mojo","user_id":7708,"investigator_code":"37001a","investigator_name":"Gambit","slots":{"13012":1,"13014":3,"18013":3,"21041":1,"25014":1,"32019":1,"32047":2,"33019":1,"35013":1,"35014":1,"35016":2,"37002":1,"37003":1,"37004":1,"37005":1,"37006":3,"37007":2,"37008":2,"37009":2,"37010":2,"37019":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"04040":1,"09037":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":""},{"id":26954,"name":"Gambit","date_creation":"2023-03-16T20:15:26+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-16T20:15:26+00:00","description_md":"gambit rojo","user_id":15738,"investigator_code":"37001a","investigator_name":"Gambit","slots":{"13013":2,"18012":3,"20029":1,"28017":1,"32019":1,"32020":1,"32047":2,"32048":1,"32049":1,"35013":1,"35014":1,"37002":1,"37003":1,"37004":1,"37005":1,"37006":3,"37007":2,"37008":2,"37009":2,"37010":2,"37021":2,"38018":1,"38019":1,"01054":2,"01089":1,"01092":1,"05023":1,"05030":3,"05033":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":""},{"id":26955,"name":"Colossus - Brawler","date_creation":"2023-03-16T21:15:11+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-16T21:15:11+00:00","description_md":"Test deck for TTS.","user_id":25523,"investigator_code":"32001a","investigator_name":"Colossus","slots":{"10014":3,"10018":1,"13014":3,"13019":1,"16024":1,"21019":1,"21041":1,"26022":1,"31023":3,"32002":1,"32003":1,"32004":1,"32005":1,"32006":2,"32007":2,"32008":3,"32009":2,"32010":2,"32020":1,"38018":1,"01050":1,"01057":1,"01083":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1,"06019":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"3.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":""},{"id":26956,"name":"Rainbow 7","date_creation":"2023-03-16T21:35:48+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-16T21:35:48+00:00","description_md":"ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd call for aid added","user_id":31890,"investigator_code":"21031a","investigator_name":"Adam Warlock","slots":{"10014":1,"12015":1,"13016":1,"14014":1,"16017":1,"16047":1,"17020":1,"21018":1,"21032":1,"21033":1,"21034":1,"21035":1,"21036":2,"21037":2,"21038":3,"21039":2,"21040":2,"21050":1,"21053":1,"21064":1,"22012":1,"30019":1,"31029":1,"33018":1,"01055":1,"01060":1,"01067":1,"01080":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"04040":1,"04049":1,"06017":1,"06031":1,"08030":1,"08032":1,"09015":1,"09026":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"5.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\",\"aspect2\":\"leadership\"}","tags":""},{"id":26957,"name":"Fight the Future!","date_creation":"2023-03-16T22:00:19+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-16T22:00:19+00:00","description_md":"**_The future is now; chaos is its name. What better way to fight back chaos than with a healthy dose of your own?_**\r\n\r\nLike with any Adam Warlock deck, the #1 priorities are the 2 [Mystic Senses](/card/21037). [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026) and [Soul World](/card/21033) are also high on this list- the former 3 being his main draw engine, the latter being the recovery. [Warlock's Cape](/card/21035) is important as well for multiple activations, as are the resource generators, chiefly [Karmic Staff](/card/21034) and [Clarity of Purpose](/card/31029). After that, chaos ensues, and the search for the truth begins.\r\n\r\nWe will have many options turn to turn in our quest for the truth, but that's the name of this game. We specialize in chaos, be it either from the extra encounter card from [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191), the extra encounter card from deck out, or the attacks you will withstand as you slog it out in Hero form.\r\n\r\n**The Fight**\r\n\r\nFortunately, Adam's kit seems made to fight back against this dark future, as he has competent thwart and attack events coupled with the ability to play literally every aspect card in the game (albeit at 1 copy). This, to me, makes him ideally situated to take advantage of as many low-cost cards as possible, leading to a different kind of consistency. With only 3 cards in this deck costing 3 or more (2 of which are allies playable with [Summoning Spell](/card/21055)), you will usually find something productive to do with most of the cards in your hand. And considering we have a focus on colors over basics, Battle Mage gets more value, [Cosmic Awareness](/card/21039) becomes a 2 cost for ~5 threat, and [Karmic Blast](/card/21038) a 2 for ~6 damage, often even higher than those averages. And when the cards you are discarding are easy to play, [Quantum Magic](/card/21040) becomes that much better as well. Considering we are often starting with a 7 card hand and an extra 2 with the MSs, obviously this can add up quickly.\r\n\r\nFor individual card choices, we look at what can get the most benefit for the least cost. What this amounts to regarding each aspect:\r\n\r\n- **Aggression:** 2 resources- 1 of which eats toughs and the other pays by itself for two upgrades ([Combat Training](/card/01057) and [Martial Prowess](/card/10018)), as well as a 1 cost 1-5 damage ([Magic Attack](/card/21043)).\r\n\r\n- **Justice:** A 1 cost confuse ([\"Think Fast!\"](/card/19031)), a 0 cost permanent draw ([Skilled Investigator](/card/04047)), a 0 cost -side scheme notwithstanding- draw 3 ([One Way or Another](/card/22015)), a 1 cost 2-4 threat removal ([Multitasking](/card/15013)), and a 1 cost 1-4 threat removal ([Zone of Silence](/card/21050))\r\n\r\n- **Leadership:** A 1 cost permanent resource generator ([Clarity of Purpose](/card/31029)), a 2 cost [Nick Fury](/card/01084) or [Beast](/card/33011) ([Summoning Spell](/card/21055)) a 2 cost way to instantly recur them ([Rapid Response](/card/08031)), and the <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> resource needed to play these bigger cards more efficiently.\r\n\r\n- **Protection:** A 0 cost permanent minion removal-esque ([Pinned Down](/card/33034)), a 1 cost permanent retaliate in [Dauntless](/card/16016) (with Symbiote Suit), a 1 cost status clearer ([The Night Nurse](/card/09019)), a 1 cost -villain attack notwithstanding- treachery cancel ([Get Behind Me!](/card/01078)), and a 0 cost prevent all damage ([Shield Spell](/card/21061))\r\n\r\nWith all the upgrades out, and with how easy it is to get them out, it's easy to see the majority of your deck in only a turn or two once you get set up, especially with all the card discarding you are doing. We minimize the number of greens in deck as that is the color that gets the least value off the Battle Mage ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Other considerations:**\r\n\r\n\r\n[Kaluu](/card/21014) and [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012) are both excellent allies for any deck that can run them. The problem I find with this deck in particular is that they just don't do enough on paper for me to include them. You want to hit [Nick Fury](/card/01084) or [Beast](/card/33011) with [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) pretty much 10 out of 10 times over either of those, since drawing cards and getting resources do more for setup and longevity than a single event, as, in my experience, the deck has no shortage of things you can usually do in a turn, apart from extending or needing resources to do them. I could see BV being brought in over something like [Dauntless](/card/16016), which feels like filler most of the time; more games might make me see the light.\r\n\r\n[Deft Focus](/card/16024) is a card I so badly want to play in here. With 7 superpower cards it seems like a natural fit. But with already 3 resource generators it just missed the cut. I'm sure you could throw it in here for 41 cards; I just elected not to.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Closing Thoughts**\r\n\r\nI will say this Adam Warlock build is most definitely not a beginner's friend - you really need to know what you're doing and weigh each turn carefully in order to not be overrun by nasty encounter cards/villain activations. Symbiote Suit could very easily prove to be your undoing if you play it before your team is prepared to deal with the extra encounters, or if you're playing against a particularly difficult scenario. A leadership teammate with many blockers is always nice to have.\r\n\r\nAll said, there are likely other/better options I simply overlooked. A deck like this lends itself to quite a bit of personal preference and individual tinkering and tweaking from game to game; not to mention personal cardpool availability (14 packs seems like a ton).\r\n\r\nMy first impression with AW precon was not great, it just didn’t seem to click for me. But I gave it another try, and I've had a blast with it so far; try AW out if you're looking for something different, fun, and chaotic to bring to the table!\r\n\r\n**_The future is bleak, but we fight nonetheless.

The healing from [_Endurance_](/card/05023) and [_X-Mansion_](/card/32049) should help to survive going to hero form without using the recovery action.

The [Sneak Attack](/card/23017) strategy allows you to play high-cost allies that you'd not often get out.  An Asgardian/Avenger deck using [Beta Ray Bill](/card/17012) and [Heimdall](/card/06020) with heroes Thor or Valkyrie is fun, but Capt'n A can defend and ready all day, surviving this strategy better than the Asgardians.\r\n\r\nStrategy:  Mulligan for one of the six resource generators/savers and build those up over the game.  Also keep any [Shield Block](/card/03005)s.  Use [Sneak Attack](/card/23017) along with [Go Down Swinging](/card/23019) and [Save the Day](/card/23018) to get out allies cheaply and get the most out of their cost before the end of the phase.  Once your generators are up, you can pay for an ally to come out and use them for their high stats while still defending with the Capt'n for the shield's retaliate.  Keep using those 0-cost discard attacks/thwarts just before they run out of health, and use allies to block minions.  All of the Captain's cards are good, so use them to stay flexible.\r\n\r\nWith the Capt'n defending attacks, he'll slowly lose health, so it seems better to use [Down Time](/card/05033) rather than squeeze in another resource helper like [Helicarrier](/card/01092).  Prioritize that with [Steve's Apartment](/card/03007).  You'll find less chump blockers at the beginning of the game until your resource gens are setup.\r\n\r\nCards I chose not to use:  [Maria Hill](/card/01067) is always a multiplayer fave, but I used White Tiger for the card draw and stat line in solo.  [Captain Marvel](/card/04032) is out because there's no energy synergy in this deck.  Hard not to include [Endurance](/card/05023) in every deck, but I'd rather flip down and use [Steve's Apartment](/card/03007) and [Down Time](/card/05033) since there are so many high thwart allies and [Save the Day](/card/23018)s.  [Call for Aid](/card/12015) would get allies in hand, but I'd rather just include more allies. \r\n\r\nA higher number low-cost ally leadership deck with [Avengers Tower](/card/04021), [The Triskelion](/card/01073), and [Stinger](/card/12014) with [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) and [Band Together](/card/21018) is undoubtedly a better deck.  This is a gambling deck to get [Sneak Attack](/card/23017), an ally, and [Save the Day](/card/23018) or [Go Down Swinging](/card/23019) in the same hand.  When it all comes together, it feels great.

Let met present you my first published deck!\r\n\r\nWith this deck I tried to create some synergies in order to have many ressources generators and many readies. When totally built, with the readies and [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004), in one turn:\r\n- Rogue can deal up to 9 damages\r\n- Rogue can thwart up to 9 threats\r\n\r\nHere are some interactions you can have during a game:\r\n- Ressources:\r\n  - [Clea](/card/09013) allows you to play the [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026). She is also a cheap ally who go back to the deck when defeated. Then she can come back a lot during a game and then, maximize your chance to play the Sorcerer Supreme.\r\n  - [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012) allows you to play [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026). He is a 3-cost ally (or two with his reponse) and has the Avenger trait, which allows you to play [Quincarrier](/card/08023). Then the objective is to keep [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012) alive until you have [Quincarrier](/card/08023) in your hand.\r\n  - [Deft Focus](/card/16024) & [X-Gene](/card/38019) are low-cost generators for Rogue's cards ans can be played easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Readies:\r\n - [Utopia](/card/33020) is great with 6 X-Men allies.\r\n - [Professor X](/card/32019) can ready her if [Utopia](/card/33020) is not in play.\r\n - [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) is great since it readies, heals & deals 2 damage. [What Doesn't Kill Me](/card/27016) does the same minus the damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Tough: My second goal with this deck is to have many Tough status cards. Between [Polaris](/card/32012), [Armor](/card/38102) and [Bulletproof Protector](/card/32009), you can have many options. And with [Hard Knocks](/card/19016), you can deal damage & tough in a heavy-minions scenarios.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this is an expensive deck and it takes time to fully build [Rogue](/card/38001a). It had been tested true solo against expert [Klaw](/card/01113) & Reavers modular set and I will try it with another scenarios.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, feel free to give me some feedbacks. Would you change some cards or all of it?\r\n\r\nAnd for those you read this, thank you!","user_id":9503,"investigator_code":"38001a","investigator_name":"Rogue","slots":{"16024":1,"19016":3,"27016":3,"32011":1,"32012":1,"32019":1,"32020":1,"33020":1,"38002":1,"38003":1,"38004":1,"38005":3,"38006":3,"38007":2,"38008":2,"38009":3,"38010":1,"38012":1,"38019":1,"01079":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"08023":1,"09012":1,"09013":1,"09026":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":27007,"name":"Ironheart Justice - Sam's Game Cave","date_creation":"2023-03-18T17:15:12+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-18T17:15:12+00:00","description_md":"https://youtu.be/6XlJ56kyUMQ","user_id":1710,"investigator_code":"29001a","investigator_name":"Ironheart","slots":{"12024":1,"12033":3,"13024":2,"14030":1,"15013":2,"22015":2,"28018":1,"28020":1,"29004":1,"29005":2,"29006":3,"29007":2,"29008":1,"29009":2,"29010":1,"29011":1,"29012":1,"29013":1,"29023":1,"29024":1,"29025":1,"29027":1,"29034":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"04047":1,"04049":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":""},{"id":27008,"name":"Allyclops","date_creation":"2023-03-18T17:19:15+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-18T17:19:15+00:00","description_md":"aergasedrgea54g","user_id":8299,"investigator_code":"33001a","investigator_name":"Cyclops","slots":{"32011":1,"32012":1,"32019":1,"32020":1,"32048":1,"32049":1,"33002":1,"33003":1,"33004":1,"33005":2,"33006":2,"33007":2,"33008":1,"33009":2,"33010":3,"33011":1,"33014":1,"33019":1,"33020":1,"34022":1,"35013":1,"35014":1,"36016":1,"36017":1,"36018":1,"36020":3,"36022":1,"37012":1,"38012":1,"38028":1,"01073":1,"03021":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"3.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":""},{"id":27009,"name":"Ironheart’s Aggressive Champions","date_creation":"2023-03-18T18:16:54+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-18T18:16:54+00:00","description_md":"I noticed there weren’t a lot of Ironheart aggression decks and figured I’d make one since it’s my favorite aspect to play. \r\n\r\nClaim to fame: This deck completed the Sinister Motives Campaign on expert solo(minus the autofail on loss to Venom goblin. Took me three tries)\r\n\r\nObviously the main objective in any Ironheart deck is to get her to Version 3.\r\n\r\nThis deck has two secondary focuses: \r\n\r\nUse Champion Allies for use with “Go For Champions”\r\n\r\nUtilize the abundance of wild and mental resources  to fuel Honed Technique\r\n\r\nAs mentioned your primary focus should still be to get Ironheart to version 3. This means using Stroke of Genius, Fly Over and Photon Beam whenever possible and being ok with flipping down to use Child Prodigy and Ronnie Williams.\r\n\r\nOnce you are in Version 3 this is still the primary goal as she can deal massive amounts of damage using progress counters without having to exhaust or “attack”. This is especially useful against Venom Goblin where I recommend building enough progress to make sure you can kill his 3rd form in the exact same turn as his second to avoid 3 additional encounter cards.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the different cards in a bit more detail:\r\n\r\nBrawn: Such an excellent ally. 2 THW and 3ATK is already great but the fact that he can generate an additional mental resource while exhausted means he’s almost always worth putting out.\r\n\r\nMoon Girl: She should pretty much always be in your Ironheart deck.  This deck is abundant in mental resources. Use stroke of genius too and not only will you always get her down for free, you can end up with more cards in hand than you started! \r\n\r\nSnowguard: a great versatile ally. The 3 ATK is especially helpful against Sandman when you can exhaust her to clear sand counters. If you’re behind on threat she can also really come to the rescue. She may seem expensive but with two copies of Power in All of Us you’ll find yourself playing her often.\r\n\r\nVivian: At first glance I wasn’t sure about her. Now that I’ve played her I absolutely love her! How many times have you had a simple scheme or enemy with a troubling side effect for being in play or for completing it. Vivian is perfect for these situations. Pop her in, get around the problem! She’s saved me often from a loss by bypassing a patrol or guard. \r\n\r\nThe Locust: being able to pull an event from discard is great even if you pull it just to use as a resource.\r\n\r\nSpider-Man Miles: A burst of 3 THW or 4ATK can sometimes be the difference between a win and a loss \r\n\r\nEvents:\r\n\r\nMelee: 3 damage twice is great for taking down minions. It’s also a mental resource so you’ll often use it for that. Combined with Honed Technique you have incredible damage potential. The 3 cost is also important because you can chuck it to get rid of the advanced glider \r\n\r\nPitch back: mainly in the deck because it’s cheap. I don’t love it. Can’t be used until Version 2. However it can be great to get rid of pesky minions and a good added target for Locust to pull back. \r\n\r\nDive Bomb: Its up to you if you want to add more pitch back or more dive bomb. It can be good for a great big punch able to do 11 damage with Honed Technique. It can also ping low health minions at the same time. \r\n\r\nGo all out: this card isn’t in the deck but it’s the card I selected during the campaign to add from a different aspect. \r\n\r\nGo For Champions: This card is absolutely wild. Attack with all your allies without consequence and then sit tight the following villain phase as nothing is able to touch you. All of your allies are champions too. This also works in multiplayer and you can use your allies to defend for your friends.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\nGenius is obviously the star of the show but strength and energy can pull their weight as usual. Power in all of us is going to help constantly getting out your basic allies supports and upgrades and the wild resource also helps when you need specific resource types \r\n\r\nSupport:\r\n\r\nTeam Building Exercise: Great for getting down your champion allies at a discount.\r\n\r\nAvengers Mansion: Power in all of us can help you pay for this. Some may prefer helicarrier but in this case I prefer the mansion since it helps find more Ironheart cards and you can’t combine helicarrier and team building exercise. You also get a helicarrier during the Sinister Motives Campaign\r\n\r\nChampions Mobile Bunker: just a great way to find the cards you need when you need them\r\n\r\nBoot Camp: I don’t always have to to play this but it’s a nice boost for your allies and it’s a mental resource so you’ll be happy to have it\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\n\r\nIngenuity: A no brainer\r\n\r\nEnhances Awareness: Cheap, effective mental resource generators. Another great pairing for Power In All of Us\r\n\r\nHoned Technique: not required to put out for the deck to run but certainly a great win more card and it’s a mental resource so you’ll always be happy to see it in hand\r\n\r\nSo that’s pretty much it. Focus on getting to Version 3 while getting out Allies and supports. I would say it’s sometimes better to get an ally or support out than get more counters and in certain fights you might even be able to stay down in alter ego the first two turns and still recover from it. Venom Goblin is obviously still really tough. It certainly takes some luck of the draw and my advice is not to try and burst him down but instead get the board under control. Then stack progress until you can wipe him out in one turn. I had Wave Bracers for my campaign which helped with defense and protected against confuse/stun. Dive Bomb and Melee should help you get rid of his awful glider. I honestly would not recommend Symbiote Suit in the final fight as I think the extra encounter card can really hurt so you may want to keep your reputation below 25 to avoid that extra encounter card against the Goblin since the first 2-3 turn are always the diciest. Please like the deck and comment if you enjoy it.

This is a stun-focused deck, or a sword-focused deck versus stalwart villains.   \r\n\r\nStrategy:  Mulligan for [Keen Instincts](/card/18009), [Martial Prowess](/card/10018), and [Helicarrier](/card/01092).  These will fuel [Drop Kick](/card/10014) stuns.  Also try to get [Team-Building Exercise](/card/12024) and [Knowhere](/card/17022) out.  Most of these allies you can get out very cheaply.  \r\n\r\n[Clear the Area](/card/04049) I prefer over [Powerful Punch](/card/32014) and [Tackle](/card/05015) so that there are more thwart events to add damage to [Decisive Blow](/card/18006) and to ensure her Precision ability is used more.\r\n[First Hit](/card/18015) and other Protection cards will trigger a threat removal during the villain phase.  \r\n\r\nOverall I chose aggression for all of the allies that you can get out cheaper with [Team-Building Exercise](/card/12024).  This allows more [Knowhere](/card/17022) card draw.  [Helicarrier](/card/01092) can help if it wasn't used for an event.\r\n\r\nOnce your six support/upgrade generators are set up, you could pay for a [First Hit](/card/18015) to damage a minion and remove one threat during the villain phase, then during your turn use a [Drop Kick](/card/10014) with stun and get out an ally for free or one cost, leaving 1 to 2 cards in hand for an additional event, hopefully a thwart to use both Finesse and Precision again.  \r\n\r\nFor stalwart villains, I replace the [Drop Kick](/card/10014)s and [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) with [Mean Swing](/card/06015)s and add [Godslayer](/card/18018) in case you get it out before [Gamora's Sword](/card/18010).  The two together with the swing will carve out some nice 7 damage villain steaks and her sword's ability will add to Gamora's other attack events, making the sword cost worth it.  \r\n\r\nCards I chose not to use:  [Assault Training](/card/26033) is good for reusing [Drop Kick](/card/10014)s but Gamora has lots of good cards.  [Enhanced Physique](/card/06034) is good to pay for those stuns but felt unnecessary just to support three cards.  [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) is worth the cost if played early but the focus here is on the event/ally generators; I also prefer it thematically only with Asgardians.","user_id":31190,"investigator_code":"18001a","investigator_name":"Gamora","slots":{"10014":3,"10018":1,"12024":1,"16019":1,"16040":1,"16047":1,"17020":1,"17022":1,"18002":1,"18003":2,"18004":2,"18005":2,"18006":2,"18007":2,"18008":1,"18009":2,"18010":1,"18015":3,"18019":1,"21041":1,"21065":1,"25014":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1,"04049":3,"05023":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":27013,"name":"into the spiderverse/movie theme","date_creation":"2023-03-18T22:46:09+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-18T22:49:43+00:00","description_md":"only using the characters from the movie \r\nfor a flavor run\r\n\r\nside note:\r\nthe soundtrack playing in the background is a must\r\n\r\nalso for extra flavor:\r\nthe villain line up from movie\r\n(Osborn to replace kingpin)\r\n\r\nOsborn \r\nmod: tombstone (running interference)\r\n\r\ngreen goblin\r\nmod: sinister assult\r\n\r\nsinister six (mainly for doc & scorpion)\r\nmod: down to earth","user_id":27714,"investigator_code":"27030a","investigator_name":"Spider-Man","slots":{"13024":2,"14017":1,"27014":3,"27018":1,"27023":1,"27031":2,"27032":2,"27033":2,"27034":3,"27035":1,"27036":1,"27037":1,"27038":1,"27039":2,"27048":1,"27049":1,"28020":1,"30021":1,"31015":1,"31017":3,"31020":3,"31021":1,"38016":3,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":""}],[{"id":27014,"name":"50 cards of shade","date_creation":"2023-03-19T00:03:46+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-19T00:03:46+00:00","description_md":"asddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd","user_id":31890,"investigator_code":"08001a","investigator_name":"Black Widow","slots":{"10012":1,"10016":1,"13016":1,"13017":1,"13024":1,"14018":1,"15028":1,"16043":2,"18012":1,"18013":2,"25013":1,"26033":1,"26036":1,"27046":1,"37030":1,"01055":1,"01056":1,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"03024":1,"04040":1,"06011":1,"06012":1,"06017":1,"08002":1,"08003":2,"08004":2,"08005":1,"08006":2,"08007":2,"08008":2,"08009":1,"08010":2,"08023":1,"08024":1,"08030":2,"08033":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":""},{"id":27015,"name":"Protection at Low Cost","date_creation":"2023-03-19T00:19:36+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-19T00:20:25+00:00","description_md":"Using this deck I managed to defeat Expert Zola playing solo.","user_id":28767,"investigator_code":"04001a","investigator_name":"Hawkeye","slots":{"13018":1,"14014":2,"16012":1,"16017":1,"21019":1,"21064":1,"26018":2,"26022":1,"33034":2,"01077":2,"01081":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"04002":1,"04003":1,"04004":1,"04005":2,"04006":2,"04007":2,"04008":2,"04009":2,"04010":2,"05017":1,"05023":1,"08023":1,"09015":2,"09020":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":"solo"},{"id":27016,"name":"41","date_creation":"2023-03-19T00:44:23+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-19T00:44:23+00:00","description_md":"asddddddddddddddddasdddddddddddddd","user_id":31890,"investigator_code":"08001a","investigator_name":"Black Widow","slots":{"10012":1,"13017":1,"13024":1,"14018":1,"15028":1,"16043":1,"18012":1,"18013":1,"25013":1,"26033":1,"26036":1,"27046":1,"01055":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"04040":1,"06012":1,"06017":1,"08002":1,"08003":2,"08004":2,"08005":1,"08006":2,"08007":2,"08008":2,"08009":1,"08010":2,"08023":1,"08024":1,"08030":2,"08033":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"2.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":""},{"id":27017,"name":"SP//dr Suit","date_creation":"2023-03-19T01:28:50+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-19T01:28:50+00:00","description_md":"Test with Repurpose & SP//Dr Suit","user_id":29128,"investigator_code":"31001a","investigator_name":"SP//dr Suit","slots":{"14015":2,"14017":1,"27010":1,"27014":2,"27016":1,"27048":1,"27049":1,"31003":1,"31004":3,"31005":2,"31006":2,"31007":1,"31008":1,"31009":1,"31010":1,"31011":1,"31012":1,"31013":1,"31016":2,"31019":2,"31022":1,"31024":1,"01081":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"05017":2,"09012":1,"09015":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":""},{"id":27018,"name":"Black Panther Weapon Upgrades","date_creation":"2023-03-19T02:06:58+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-19T02:06:58+00:00","description_md":"This deck is based on the abilities that Black Panther has with his Upgrades.

Effectively giving you 3 copies of each event while only running a single copy.\r\n\r\nI was a little strict in keeping to single copies of everything, I wouldn't expect anyone else to have to do that.

I must say though this worked very well for me!\r\n\r\n### **Singleplayer**\r\n\r\nThis works extremely well true solo! I found this deck does an excellent job pulling out what you need to overcome most scenarios. You have a suite of Guardian allies that help utilize some great cards like [\"Think Fast!\"](/card/19031) and [Gamora](/card/19020). There's great targets to pull if you are behind on threat ([For Justice!](/card/01060), [Clear the Area](/card/04049)), if you want to recur some key cards ([Mutant Education](/card/37021)), or just draw more cards ([Assess the Situation](/card/12033)). However, I primarily play this game in Multiplayer and that's when our dear plant [Groot](/card/16001a) comes into the picture\r\n\r\n### **Multiplayer**\r\n\r\nGroot really is a great partner for Rogue. Both [\"I am Groot\"](/card/16003) and [\"I. AM. GROOT!\"](/card/16004) are exceptional targets for [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) and can really help control the game's threat or rush down most villains if needed. Most importantly it gives Rogue more options! Also [Deft Focus](/card/16024) and [X-Gene](/card/38019) both can be used to play Groot's events. It is not uncommon for Rogue to do 20+ damage in a turn and Groot can still play the same cards himself possibly! Highly complimentary pairing. I played Groot in Aggression for which you can find a link to it below:\r\n\r\n# Groot Team Up Deck\r\n***\r\nhttps://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/27021/rng-rogue-n-groot-team-up-1.0","user_id":11440,"investigator_code":"38001a","investigator_name":"Rogue","slots":{"12033":1,"14030":1,"16024":1,"17020":1,"19020":1,"19031":1,"21047":1,"22011":1,"22012":1,"22015":1,"22035":1,"29024":1,"30019":1,"32020":1,"32049":1,"34020":1,"36022":1,"37021":1,"38002":1,"38003":1,"38004":1,"38005":3,"38006":3,"38007":2,"38008":2,"38009":3,"38019":1,"01060":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"04047":1,"04049":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer"},{"id":27021,"name":"RnG (Rogue ‘n Groot Team Up)","date_creation":"2023-03-19T06:01:03+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-20T12:20:27+00:00","description_md":"# **I am Groot**\r\n***He says he met a nice lady the other day who touched him and turned her arm into a tree and punched a magnet guy.***\r\n***\r\n\r\n### **The premise**\r\n\r\n>Team up with Rogue!!!! Feed Rogue a [Martial Prowess](/card/10018), confuse the villain and help maintain threat with [Professor X](/card/32019) and [Psylocke](/card/35013), and GROW THEM COUNTERS!!!\r\n\r\nGroot really is a great partner for Rogue.

Most importantly it gives Rogue more options! The aggression aspect is also great because it lets Groot more easily confuse the villain, and get a resource generator to Rogue in [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) to be able to more easily afford/pull off those huge damage turns. That's not to say Groot doesn't contribute either, nay. There are plenty of ways in this deck for Groot to dish out the pain or help control threat. End game you can just do massive amounts of damage between the two.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the oddest card in this deck is [Enhanced Reflexes](/card/05024), but the reason is to more easily hit [Sunfire](/card/35014)'s kicker. I was looking for more energy resources and this was pulling double duty as a 25th card. If you find yourself not playing or struggling against attachments then you can make some adjustments there. I just found attachements were rough for these two and Sunfire and [Vivian](/card/29024) help a lot. \r\n\r\nThe trickiest part about playing the two together is lining up the decks so that Rogue isn't reaching the bottom of her deck with two [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) and Groot just decked. Just something you will want to be mindful of as you play.

Will start testing on Expert.\r\n\r\n## General Deck Overview\r\nX-Men allies working as a team with the benefits of time in the Danger Room hit harder than the some of their parts. A deck built around the Uncanny X-Men team card, key tutors, Cyclopian tactics and a pinch of recursion.\r\n\r\n## Key Cards And Combos\r\n[Danger Room Training](/card/33015) and [Uncanny X-Men](/card/36018) keep allies around longer, so I lean into that with some recursion from [Pixie](/card/36017) and [Rapid Response](/card/08031) - which, as a **Tactic Upgrade**, I can search for with _Constant Training_. Uncanny X-men is a card I would absolutely mulligan for because it just helps the economy so much - particularly when most of my allies are 2 and 3 cost.\r\n\r\n[Game Time](/card/33022) is an obvious go to for big thwart or damage turns as I'll primarily be using it on allies with 3 minimum attack or thwart.\r\n\r\n[Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) just smooths the economy out between Uncanny X-Men and [Danger Room](/card/33021) so you can take advantage of both buffs at the same time. Once you have both out, though, there's 3 \"dead\" resource cards in your deck to be aware of.\r\n\r\n[The X-Jet](/card/32020) and [Utopia](/card/33020) are fairly standard X-Men supports. Utopia's value is less about the additional ally slot and more leveraging the additional health from Uncanny X-Men and Danger Room Training for more multiple ally turns.\r\n\r\n[Priority Target](/card/33007) is the card I'll fish for most often with Constant Training and [Phoenix](/card/33002), particularly when I have [Ruby Quartz Visor](/card/33003) out because turning Optic Blast into card draw for free is awesome.\r\n\r\n[Tactical Brillance](/card/33010) allows you to grab [Game Time](/card/33022) and [Rapid Response](/card/08031) from the discard pile, so I don't worry about using them for resources if I don't need them right away.\r\n\r\n## Allies\r\nBecause I have a bit of recursion with Rapid Response, I've stuck with good \"enters play\" effects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- [Beast](/card/33011)'s net cost is 1 when Uncanny X-Men is up, for a 2 attack, 2 thwart, 4 health ally.\r\n- Likewise [Angel](/card/33019) makes the cut without an enters play effect because he's a 1 cost ally with 2,1,4.\r\n- With Danger Room being key to bulking up the allies, [Forge](/card/36022) tutoring for it makes sense. Recurring him to dig out Utopia ain't a bad idea either.\r\n- I believe the sequencing for [Mirage](/card/36015) entering play, then Danger Room triggering, then Mirage's card text working is OK, so Stunning most villains is possible.\r\n \r\n## Bubble Cards\r\n[X-Mansion](/card/32049). The synergy with healing allies with Danger Room Training to do more work is obvious, and this deck needs to be comfortable flipping back to alter-ego form to get the training upgrades out. However, as an early draw it doesn't have a huge amount of value. Because Forge allows searching the discard pile, you can use X-Mansion as a resource and search for it later, but when I lay my hands on the other X-Men releases, [Cerebro](/card/34022) likely gets a run in this slot, particularly if the ally mix continues to contain Blindfold, Mirage and Phoenix. Alternatively, I will never say no to another [Game Time](/card/33022)\r\n\r\n## Other Ally Choices\r\nAs this deck is only built with allies from the Storm and Cyclops sets, some other Allies that have caught my eye that could slot in. First cuts from the deck would likely be [Mirage](/card/36015) and [Angel](/card/33019) but if I can live without [Blindfold](/card/33014)'s enters play ability I may switch her up too.\r\n[Colossus](/card/32001a) is just a solid body made cheap by Uncanny X-Men. Armor is a great cheap block from the toughness with follow up work thanks to training and team. [Polaris](/card/32012) and [Iceman](/card/38010) provide good effects. [Wolverine](/card/32041) breaks my rule of making mid cost characters cheap but he makes a great finisher once the upgrades are out and Game Time is in hand.","user_id":31377,"investigator_code":"33001a","investigator_name":"Cyclops","slots":{"33002":1,"33003":1,"33004":1,"33005":2,"33006":2,"33007":2,"33008":1,"33009":2,"33010":3,"33011":1,"33014":1,"33015":3,"33019":1,"33020":1,"33021":1,"33022":2,"33024":1,"33025":1,"33026":1,"33035":2,"36015":1,"36017":1,"36018":3,"36022":1,"36023":1,"36025":1,"08031":2},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":""},{"id":27075,"name":"Rogue - Aliados proteger a Picara","date_creation":"2023-03-20T18:27:25+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-20T18:27:25+00:00","description_md":"Picara lleva un grupo de hombres X contra las amenazas del universo, asi que estaras dispuesto a proteger la tierra.","user_id":15066,"investigator_code":"38001a","investigator_name":"Rogue","slots":{"12024":1,"13024":1,"14017":1,"17030":3,"27016":2,"32011":1,"32012":1,"32017":3,"32019":1,"32020":1,"32048":1,"33013":1,"33019":1,"33020":1,"36022":1,"36035":1,"38002":1,"38003":1,"38004":1,"38005":3,"38006":3,"38007":2,"38008":2,"38009":3,"38019":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer"},{"id":27076,"name":"Valkyrie's Aggresive Thwarting","date_creation":"2023-03-20T18:52:49+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-20T18:52:49+00:00","description_md":"This deck is designed for Multiplayer and sits on a border between board (minion) control and threat control.","user_id":17246,"investigator_code":"25001a","investigator_name":"Valkyrie","slots":{"10011":1,"13013":2,"13016":1,"16043":3,"18011":1,"19030":3,"20029":1,"25002":1,"25003":1,"25004":1,"25005":1,"25006":1,"25007":1,"25008":2,"25009":1,"25010":2,"25011":2,"25012":3,"25014":1,"32044":2,"35014":1,"37030":1,"01052":2,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"06017":1,"08023":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"multiplayer"},{"id":27079,"name":"Colossus - Gamma-X","date_creation":"2023-03-20T21:15:57+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-20T21:17:54+00:00","description_md":"All out aggression - key is to land the big attack allies (She Hulk or Wolverine) and keep them in play - colossus takes the hits, or the off Ally goes under the bus (they are primarily in place for utility).\r\n\r\nBolster their Attack and Health, then Team Strike the Villain into Oblivion - best case hit for 1 cost is 4 (from Colossus) + 5(wolverine+atk train+boot) + 8(She-Hulk+Atk Train+Boot+5 Dam)= 17\r\n\r\nThen hold them until they heal a bit, or make use of the First Aids to enable non-team attacks.","user_id":7874,"investigator_code":"32001a","investigator_name":"Colossus","slots":{"10013":1,"13016":1,"16024":1,"32002":1,"32003":1,"32004":1,"32005":1,"32006":2,"32007":2,"32008":3,"32009":2,"32010":2,"32019":1,"32041":1,"32042":1,"32043":3,"32045":3,"33035":2,"35013":1,"35014":1,"35023":1,"01055":2,"01057":1,"01086":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer"},{"id":27080,"name":"Code Blue","date_creation":"2023-03-20T22:08:30+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-20T22:08:30+00:00","description_md":"Despite her reputation as a solo operative, Agent Romanoff is quite the team player (as long as the team follows her lead)","user_id":16832,"investigator_code":"08001a","investigator_name":"Black Widow","slots":{"12024":1,"23016":2,"27046":1,"27047":1,"27054":1,"27055":1,"29020":2,"38028":2,"01067":1,"01069":2,"01083":1,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"04013":1,"08002":1,"08003":2,"08004":2,"08005":1,"08006":2,"08007":2,"08008":2,"08009":1,"08010":2,"08031":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"multiplayer, theme"},{"id":27081,"name":"Captain Marvel Core Set","date_creation":"2023-03-20T22:34:12+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-20T22:34:12+00:00","description_md":"Un deck commandement pour Captain Marvel aka Carol Danvers.\r\n\r\nLe but du deck est de pouvoir être utilisé par n'importe quel débutant avec juste la boite de base.\r\n\r\nAffinité Commandement:\r\nJe pense que l'affinité Commandement est la plus facile à maitriser au début (ou en tout cas je pense que c'est l'affinité qui possède les meilleurs cartes dans la boite de base).\r\n\r\n40 cartes:\r\nJ'ai tenté de mettre le plus de cartes de type Energie possible pour optimiser au mieux les [Photonic Blast](/card/01013) et les [Energy Channel](/card/01018).

One of my friends in our play group has been playing the Wild Tutor Warlock deck and loving it. So we were joking with them saying “when you finally move on from Warlock you’ll just play the ally Warlock.” Well, that got the gears turning in my head. What if there was a way to make the ally version of Adam Warlock playable?\r\n\r\nThe first iteration of the deck was a Spider-Woman deck-mainly to leverage Med Team to keep Adam alive. Turns out it’s really hard to balance out green and blue cards to make a viable build. Then I had a crazy idea- what if we could build two decks, one green and one blue, that way the Warlock player could just play all those sweet upgrades and the green player could keep Warlock healthy? Seems like a stretch, but it’s actually kind of interesting. \r\n\r\nTo make this happen, my thought was we’d need a Guardian character and an Avenger character- that way we could put all the upgrades on Warlock. That narrowed down the choices a fair bit- we came up with Venom, Rocket, or Star-Lord for the Guardian and Cap, Spider-Man, or Captain Marvel for the Avenger. \r\n\r\nI won’t bore you with all the details of the Avenger characters; turns out this line is rather unnecessary, as we’d only be playing an Avenger for Honorary Avenger and Sky Cycle. \r\n\r\nSo back to the Guardians: My first pick was Venom and, spoiler, that’s who we went with. I chose him because of his ability to be independent: if your core deck strategy doesn’t go as planned, there’s always his Multi-Gun, Pistols, and Run and Gun. Good old fashioned Venom play. \r\n\r\nRocket was an interesting selection, mainly based on his card Salvage getting us two Warlock effects when discarded- 3 damage and whatever your other flavor would be. Pretty powerful. \r\n\r\nStar-Lord was a bit of an after thought, mainly just leveraging him for his ability to turn all allies into Guardians- erases the need for 3 Honorary Guardian in the list, so we could play something else. \r\n\r\nSo what about the second deck? Turns out that a second deck might not be totally necessary, although a good protection deck that may or may not have Med Team would be a perfect pairing. We tested this with a Ghost-Spider protection deck and it performed admirably. Our play group is consistently 4 players, so she’s the best protection character for that setting. For 2 players though, any protection deck should suffice. I will say that I haven’t tested this solo yet- I imagine that it would do well though, because (1) it’s Venom and (2) we can use Warlock to heal Venom so taking damage isn’t all that scary. Plus if we need to flip and heal, Project Rebirth 2.0 makes that easy. \r\n\r\nNow let’s talk about this deck!\r\nWe already discussed why we chose Venom as the hero and Adam Warlock is our build around, so we’ll just be discussing the leadership and basic cards. \r\n\r\n[First Aid](/card/01086)- Maybe the only deck this card is good in. Keeps Warlock healthy. \r\n\r\n[Innovation](/card/21058)- It’s a wild for Warlock to discard and heals him when spent.\r\n\r\n[The Power of Leadership](/card/01072)- Gets Command Team down and it’s a wild for Warlock to discard. \r\n\r\n[Command Team](/card/23016)- Lets us use Warlock multiple times in a turn. \r\n\r\n[Team Training](/card/04016)- Makes Warlock a bit larger. \r\n\r\n[Comms Implant](/card/18030)- Makes Warlock a bit smarter and a bit larger.\r\n\r\n[Honorary Guardian](/card/22035)- this allows us to play Guardian locked upgrades onto Warlock. \r\n\r\n[Inspired](/card/01074)- Makes Warlock a bit smarter and a bit stronger.\r\n\r\n[Laser Blaster](/card/17019)- Makes Warlock a bit stronger.\r\n\r\n[Reinforced Suit](/card/12018)- Warlock a bit larger. \r\n\r\n[Resourceful](/card/10032)- Wild resource for Warlock to discard. Can also play them early to thin the deck a bit. \r\n\r\n[Sidearm](/card/23035)- Makes Warlock a bit stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere’s a few things I noted when playing: \r\n\r\nBuild up Venom (Multi-Gun & Pistols) or Warlock- whichever comes first. It’s pretty common that Warlock will get dumped to Flash’s ability- that’s okay. Build up Venom and hit Adam on the second pass through. \r\n\r\n[Locked and Loaded](/card/20004) is pretty versatile in this deck. Not only does it search for Venom’s weapons, it can also grab Laser Blaster and Sidearm for Adam. \r\n\r\nPlay your First Aids before you activate Warlock if possible- nothing like needing to heal him and then pitching it. This segues to my next point. \r\n\r\nSave Warlock for last. Much like the Wild Tutor deck, there are a ton of decision points once you get set up and rolling: which cards do I play? Which cards do I use to pay for those cards I want to play? Is it better to use Behind Enemy Lines to get rid of 3 threat, or discard it to deal 3 damage? Saving Warlock for last ensures that you always discard the card(s) you want to, and ordering most likely doesn’t matter. \r\n\r\nWarlock is no pushover. Once you get him fully upgraded, he’s a 3THW/4ATK with a whopping 8 hp. He’ll be okay if you can’t heal him for a few turns- just be smart about how many times you’re using him!\r\n\r\nSometimes it can be worth activating him without a card to discard when he’s fully juiced up.

With the [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) down, he is able to manage threat quite well without flipping to hero form. The [Honor Among Theives](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/26566/honor-among-thieves-1.0) deck that journeyman2 posted already has a pretty amazing write-up on how to play Gambit on that side, so check that one out if you haven't already. \r\n\r\nHowever, one of the most interesting interactions for Gambit's Thief Extraordinaire ability is that he gets to use one card to thwart, but see the next card. This _could_ be used to prepare either your boost card or encounter card for the next villain phase. But... what if you used this knowledge to feed your good boy, [Cosmo](/card/17020)??? Get where this is going???\r\n\r\nSo once you know the next type of card on top of the deck, you can use Cosmo with abandon, knowing he won't take any consequential damage. This is amazing in Aggression now that you can equip Cosmo with an [Energy Spear](/card/22032) and [Enraged](/card/03031). Enraged is the real winner, because that extra point of consequential damage really doesn't matter anymore, and now Cosmo is attacking for 5 free damage every turn with piercing. So then lets add in a [Sidearm](/card/23035), [Boot Camp](/card/13016), give him an [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) and [Attack Training](/card/32043), and now he can swing for 8 per turn! That should solve most of the Alter-Ego damage problems. \r\n\r\nFinal pieces then are to help with being able to stay in Alter-Ego all game. Being in Aggression, we have access to the best confuse-locker out there in [Psylocke](/card/35013) who we can just leave on the table for turns that we didn't pull [Creole Charmer](/card/37009). [Professor X](/card/32019) is also here when we find him, but we also are including all three copies of [X-Men Instruction](/card/37031) to shuffle them both back in quickly. Three copies of [Mutant Education](/card/37021) are also used to get Creole Charmer back into our hand again. But best of all, these 6 cards effectively let us run a 34 card deck with the [X-Mansion](/card/32049) out, as they'll just draw us a new card. They'll let you cycle your deck pretty quickly to find what you need. \r\n\r\nIf you do flip up for a turn (which you will need to do for Honorary X-Men on yourself and Cosmo), if you get to 4 counters, you can also shuffle Rogue in again with this combo and keep playing her for free every time you find her. With the X-Mansion down, you can also heal an X-Men ally over and over again, which is awesome for being able to use Psylocke still, while saving her confuse counters for when they are needed. \r\n\r\n[Marked](/card/33032) may seem like an odd choice, but we are hoping to get so much of our attack out of Cosmo in one go that a poorly timed minion can wreck our plans. With all of the attachments out, Cosmo will be be ranged and have piercing, so Marked helps to provide some timely overkill if the cards line up. \r\n\r\nThe best combo you can hope for would be to use Thief Extraordinaire to remove threat and then use the card knowledge to trigger Cosmo. If you can also play Professor X while you have Honorary X-Men on both Cosmo and Gambit, then with [Utopia](/card/33020) down, you can actually ready both of them... and do it all over again.

Thor’s basic damage output is generally decent so the aim was to boost it as much as possible, while using low cost cards to try and balance out the small hand size. Cards like mean swing or clobber allow you to dish out three extra damage for net 0-1 resource. \r\n\r\nI’ve also tried to increase the energy resources available using 3xenhanced reflexes - previously I had a mix of resource types but this is better as it synergises with the lightning cards in Thor’s deck. \r\n\r\nThe combination of Defender of the Nine Realms, Get over here, chase them down and lie in wait work really well with Thor’s hero ability and again provide more cards to play with (while knocking off some threat), again for very little resource. \r\n\r\nOverall this means I cycle through the deck quite quickly, so I can find those key Thor cards (Asgard, Thor’s helmet, God of Thunder) ASAP. \r\n\r\nSince I want to spend most of my time in hero form, I’ve added downtime to increase recovery (usually combined with Battle fury to fight, recover and be ready to flip back to hero form next player turn). \r\n\r\n\r\np.s. because we are playing a campaign I also have the +1 attack upgrade and an extra ally from Taskmaster.","user_id":22543,"investigator_code":"06001a","investigator_name":"Thor","slots":{"13011":1,"13017":3,"18012":3,"25015":1,"01052":2,"01055":2,"01057":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"05024":3,"05033":1,"06002":1,"06003":3,"06004":1,"06005":3,"06006":2,"06007":1,"06008":2,"06009":1,"06010":1,"06012":1,"06014":3,"06015":3,"06017":1,"06018":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"multiplayer"},{"id":26640,"name":"Captain America - Charismatic Leader","date_creation":"2023-03-06T09:13:30+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-06T09:13:30+00:00","description_md":"This deck is design to have many ally and hit hard the villain with \"Avengers Assemble !\" and \"Go all out\", and with the boost of \"Lead from the Front\" and \"Moral Boost\".\r\nAlly can also tank some damage if needed or thwart if menace is too high.\r\n\r\nA possible flaw of this deck : 45 cards.\r\nNB : This is my first deck  ;)","user_id":29237,"investigator_code":"03001a","investigator_name":"Captain America","slots":{"12013":1,"12014":1,"12018":2,"21013":1,"21015":1,"29017":2,"01068":1,"01070":2,"01072":2,"01073":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"03002":1,"03003":2,"03004":3,"03005":2,"03006":2,"03007":1,"03008":1,"03009":1,"03010":2,"03013":1,"03015":2,"03019":1,"03024":1,"03025":1,"04011":1,"04012":1,"04014":1,"04016":1,"05032":2,"08023":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, beginner"},{"id":26641,"name":"Gambit - Panache","date_creation":"2023-03-06T10:57:27+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-07T10:26:10+00:00","description_md":"As soon as I played the first few games with Gambit, I wanted to try Protection with his high DEF Value, [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005)and [Gambit's Staff](/card/37004).

You won't need to go back to Alter-Ego that often, as Gambit will not take a lot of damage.\r\n\r\nAfter that, you'll try to get the cards on the table which will improve your turn during the villain's phase. \r\n\r\n### Retribution\r\n[Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031), [Gambit's Staff](/card/37004) and [Flow Like Water](/card/26016) will hit the villain for 3 every time he attacks you - without paying for any card. That's on top of Damage you do with [Side Step](/card/14015) and [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014). Since you can consistently block twice with [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005) (and perhaps even a third time with [Side Step](/card/14015), Minions will also take damage.\r\n\r\nI'll mention that this Deck in an early iteration had [Dauntless](/card/16016) in it, for a further 1 damage. I did test a lot against Magneto when refining this, and Magneto sometimes just gives you 1 damage with his encounter cards you can't defend against, so Dauntless did not make sense anymore - and I usually prefer a more consistent deck against the hardest villains. But if you want to live the 4-damage-for-every-villain-attack dream, honestly, there are not that many villains who do that.

But with [Not Today!](/card/38016), [True Grit](/card/18031) and [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017), you're in a good position to handle all problems. Once you have the [Armored Vest](/card/01081) out, [True Grit](/card/18031) will thwart 4 for 1.\r\n\r\nIf you get [Professor X](/card/32019), you can take the chance to go into Alter-Ego. You will most likely get no damage, but it's nice to have one source of confusion.\r\n\r\n### Charged Cards\r\nThe double Ressources are enough to power [Charged Card](/card/37006) and [Royal Flush](/card/37007), even if you have only 2-3 cards in hands in your actual turn.

[Royal Flush](/card/37007)\r\n- 2 tsp [Surprise Attack](/card/13014)\r\n- Cajun seasoning ([Assess the Situation](/card/12033), [Mutant Education](/card/37021), [Plan of Attack](/card/18013), [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047), [Assault Training](/card/26033), & [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010))\r\n\r\nLe's started wit de jambalaya. De first step is to decide how many o' you's eatin' dis fine feast. If you alone, just make sure you flippin' every round an' usin' all your tricks. Dat mean your good ol' *Thief Extraordinaire* in Alter-ego to remove some threat and set up for your boost or encounter card. Den you gotta confuse as much as you can wit [Professor X](/card/32019) and [Creole Charmer](/card/37009). But dat's not necessary, especially if you invite de whole neighborhood to de cookout. In multiplayer, you don't need to flip as much, but you should still be flippin' most turns. Gen'rally I still flip every turn but sometime I'll take two turns in a row stayin' up.\r\n\r\nAfter you decide dat, you ready to get started seasonin' de meat wit dat good ol' cajun seasonin', den sauté until nice an' brown. Take one o' dem slotted spoons and set it aside. We gon' need it for later.\r\n\r\nWhat we got here is a lot o' flavors all workin' together. You can't 'ave jus' one, non?\r\n\r\n- [Charged Card](/card/37006) great for Overkill on minions, to pierce tough statuses, or to avoid retaliate. It's a bit more expensive compared to de other cards though, but it's modular, so you can just spend counters for what you need.\r\n- [One by One](/card/28014) is the most efficient attack, but only if you have a minion you need to defeat. If you just hittin' de villain, it don't do as much.\r\n- [Precision Strike](/card/35018) is a great way to heal up. [Moment of Triumph](/card/12030) just don't do well since it only works with [Charged Card](/card/37006) really, and your charge counters can make sure you get dat healin'. But den it don't do as well if you just want to attack de villain, just like One by One. Unlike One by One, you not getting that extra damage, so it's a trade-off no?\r\n- [Royal Flush](/card/37007) is one o' de best. It does 3 damage 3 times when you got 3 charge counters (remember dat you can't use the counter it give on itself. Just one o' dem timin' tings). But you can clear 3 minions, or put all de damage into de villain, some o' dis, some o' dat, whatever you need, but you *need* charge counters, and dis card is expensive, double de cost of most of o' de others, so you don't play it dat often. But when you do, it hit *juuuust* right, d'accord?\r\n- [Surprise Attack](/card/13014) may seem like a... surprise to be sure, but it's a welcome one, d'accord? You got plenty o' ways to pay for it wit de [The X-Jet](/card/32020) and [Martial Prowess](/card/10018), and dere ain't notin' better den de feelin' o' shufflin' in one o' dose cards with [Assault Training](/card/26033), flippin' up to hero, drawin' it off o' ol' [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018) and playin' it right away.\r\n\r\n![chef's kiss](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082259097329598575/57c9c347-6468-41c4-af5b-5907aa2887ff-2176527484.png)\r\n\r\nDe most important ting is dat you are usin' de best attack for de job. We got lots goin' on in dis stew to make sure dat happen.\r\n\r\n![cajun crime](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082222554191773806/the-secret-ingredient-is-crime-jbone666.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter dat, dis cajun seasin'll add a lot o' flavor.\r\n- [Assess the Situation](/card/12033): since we ain't got many cards over 1 cost, dem doubles can stay in de cabinet. Dis here let you just pay for cards or go for a bigger hand next round.\r\n- [Mutant Education](/card/37021) let you shuffle in some great cards. Usually I'm gettin' [Rogue](/card/37002), [Creole Charmer](/card/37009), or [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010), but sometime you need to close out de game and go for [Charged Card](/card/37006) or [Royal Flush](/card/37007). Don't worry about not drawin' dat extra card with de ol' [X-Mansion](/card/32049). You don't really need de healin', but maybe you at a table where someone else bringin' one along, you be very happy, non?\r\n- [Plan o' Attack](/card/18013) is de best for grabbin' exactly what you need. Look at 7 cards in Alter-ego or just 4 in Hero, but you can dig for exactly de right ting for de job. With 12 attacks in de deck, [Mutant Education](/card/37021) and [Assault Trainin'](/card/26033) ta shuffle 'em back in, you can be sure you also findin' de right one.\r\n- [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047) got a bit o' kick! Add it to anyting and it gives you more damage. Obviously de best is when you can use it to pay for [Royal Flush](/card/37007), but dat don't happen often. It's still great with anything though. Use it on a Surprise Attack to hit for 5! Save a counter on [One by One](/card/28014) or [Precision Strike](/card/35018), or get some extra overkill with [Charged Card](/card/37006).\r\n- [Assault Training](/card/26033) gets a lot of good value. Flip down to Alter-ego and shuffle in a [Surprise Attack](/card/13014) for next turn. Shuffle in a [Plan of Attack](/card/18013), den draw wit [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) or [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018). Lots of great options.\r\n\r\n![base](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082227236251389983/stir_in_the_base.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Makin' de Base**\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n- 2 cups [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017)\r\n- 2 cups [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018)\r\n- 3 cups [The X-Jet](/card/32020)\r\n- 2 cups [Martial Prowess](/card/10018)\r\n\r\nA good jambalaya always end wit' a proper base. Be sure to add all dese ingredients early and let simmer for a few turn to get all de flavor. Mix in de [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017), [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018), [The X-Jet](/card/32020), and de [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) in a large pot, like dem ones for boilin'. Turn it up real high now and keep stirrin' it. Den right when it 'bout to boil, you turn it right down to a simmer and den add in everyting else. Now you gotta proper jambalaya make anyone jealous.\r\n\r\n[Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) gets a lot o' use here because we flippin' a lot to alter-ego and drawin' cards's never been easier. Normally in other recipes you gotta wait till you get 6 tokens, flip, draw, then draw before you flip again on the next turn, but here you just flippin' anyway, so you can always draw at 3. Moira here to help dat card draw almost every other turn and really brings out de flavor of our spices like [Surprise Attack](/card/13014)--always a good surprise to draw one o' dose. Just remember de X-Jet ain't great for Alter-Ego. If you worried about somethin' like dat, you can always add a [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035), but I don't tink it necessary. A li'l [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) go a long way. Helps pay for any attack event, but also get de kicker for Surprise Attack. Don't skip on it and get one o' dem off-brands Dis here primo and worth it to buy de real deal.\r\n\r\n**Side Dishes**\r\n\r\nYou can't jus have jambalaya by itself! Be sure to add some side dishes. You c'n choose de best for you, but dis ol' cajun got some recommendation dujour.\r\n\r\n- [Professor X](/card/32019) is good for confusin' de villain and givin' you a reprieve in Alter-ego and Hero by blockin' a' attack as well. Good ol' Prof'll save you when you need it.\r\n- [Rogue](/card/37002) will do de same. I was de thief but she stole my heart, so how 'bout dat? She'll often be free to play with all your charge counters, and she a Tough lady--*literally*. That tough will save yer bacon.\r\n- [Sunfire](/card/35014) is a cheap ally that can do a lot o' tings, but most importantly, he can clear dose really tough attachments. If you don't need him for dat, there are some other options. We'll go over dem later.\r\n- [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) can help the Professor with confusin' de villain. Use your *Thief Extraordinaire* ability to get sometin' low and den clear it wit your charms.\r\n- [Natural Agility](/card/37008) is good sometimes. De best ting is you get charge counters when you use it, but if you have your trusty [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005), it helps you to ready.\r\n- [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) is fine. It's extra thwarting and can sometimes draw you a card, but don't count on it. Dey's not the most reliable. Remember dat it remove 1 threat, not one additional, so you need sometin' exactly 1 threat remaining to get de card.\r\n- [Battle Fury](/card/35015) is great. You don't always need it, but generally try to use it if you're exhausted and ready to go down t'Alter-ego so you can thwart a la *Thief Extraordinaire*. In dose desperate times, you c'n heal up (for a net of 2 cos it deal you 1 damage, n'est pas? But sometime you really need it).\r\n- [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005) is a 1 cost upgrade dat say: 'you always defend and sometimes you ready after'. It works great with [Natural Agility](/card/37008), and helps you to keep up your *Thief Extraordinaire*.\r\n- [Gambit's Staff](/card/37004) is just free damage. Every time an enemy attack, you gone do 1 damage to it. If it got 1 health when it attack, he don't attack. It's an interrupt, so it's great for free damage but also sometime save yo' life.\r\n\r\n![it's a trap](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082257594590171189/spice8rank.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Substitutions**\r\n\r\nNot everyting will work in dis recipe. [Warrior Skill](/card/35016), [Honed Technique](/card/28017), [Energy](/card/01088), [Genius](/card/01089), n' [Stren'th](/card/01090) all don't fittin' here. Dere's too many resources if you includin' all o' dis here. Heck, as it is we got too many, an' we only got deux! Honed is way too much setup when all our Aggression events only 1 cost. If you goin' for [No Quarter](/card/28013), best go all de way and commit to it. It's good, but ain't doin' any good here.\r\n\r\nAn' dat big elephant in de room, [Warrior Skill](/card/35016). It's great synergy here. You get 9 extra damage when you usin' all dem counters for [Royal Flush](/card/37007), but how many time you draw de best hand? How many time you got 3 counters already, want to attack de villain, got enough counters, etc. etc. Sure, it happen a lot, but not 3 times per game. [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047) already do what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nBut dese are de cards dat almost made de cut:\r\n- [Cosmo](/card/17020): a late edition thanks to teamcanadahockey2002; goes great with *Thief Extraordinaire*. It's untested cos well, I ain't thought of it, but it sounds kinda perfect.\r\n- [Hulk](/card/01050) / [Throg](/card/25014): great for soakin' up some more damage, but [Precision Strike](/card/35018) did lots o' great work to keepin' tings healthy.\r\n- [Psylocke](/card/35013): she great but she cost a pretty penny. If you need more confuse, like dose scenarios with lots o' villains. Definitely useful.\r\n- [Angela](/card/18011) / [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043): dis not necessary. You can try to do it, but you lose a lot cos you're always diggin' for stuff wit [Plan o' Attack](/card/18013). You don't need to dig for minions cos you drawin' enough with [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) seein' as y'don' need t' wait 'til you get 6.\r\n- [X-Men Instruction](/card/37031): dis a great card. Problem is you can get [Rogue](/card/37002) wit [Mutant Education](/card/37021) and dat's de best ally most o' de time. If'n you need more one-o-one time wit de Prof, maybe throw in one o' dese.\r\n- [X-Mansion](/card/32049)'s not bad but not necessary. You don't really need de healin' for me, and most allies dey's jus temporary. If'n you playin' multiplayer and someone need an [X-Mansion](/card/32049), might as well be you.\r\n- [X-Gene](/card/38019) is good if you want to play your own events more than your Aggression ones, especially for [Creole Charmer](/card/37009), since de ol' [The X-Jet](/card/32020) can't do it. I find de Aggression events usually doin' de trick most o' de time, but Creole Charmer definitely gets a lot of use.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to journeyman2, Schmendrix, & Man-is-Obsolete for all de testing and recommendations. De most important ting to remember now is good cajun cookin' take time. You rush it? And next ting you know, some angry brit yellin' at you in your kitchen. So do it right, an bon appetit!\r\n\r\n![it's RAW](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082202440495022091/giphy.gif)","user_id":5,"investigator_code":"37001a","investigator_name":"Gambit","slots":{"10018":1,"12033":3,"13014":2,"18013":3,"26033":1,"28014":3,"32019":1,"32020":1,"32047":2,"35014":1,"35015":1,"35018":2,"37002":1,"37003":1,"37004":1,"37005":1,"37006":3,"37007":2,"37008":2,"37009":2,"37010":2,"37021":2,"38018":1,"06017":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme, beginner"},{"id":26643,"name":"Gambit: Passive Aggression","date_creation":"2023-03-06T14:28:57+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-07T17:27:31+00:00","description_md":"**Deck concept**\r\n\r\nGambit is an obvious choice for an alter-ego focussed deck because of his Thief Extraordinaire ability. Rather than the regular Justice approach, though, I thought it would be interesting to try Aggression, now that [Psylocke](/card/35013) is available. \r\n\r\n**Card choices**\r\n\r\n[Tac Team](/card/01056) is a card I used to play a lot when I only had the core set, but it doesn't get that much love now. With [Sky-Destroyer](/card/27055) in play, though, it puts out decent damage, bypasses Retaliate, and you can squeeze a little extra damage out of each one with [Dum Dum Dugan](/card/27047). So I decided to make this a crossover X-Men/S.H.I.E.L.D. deck.\r\n\r\n**Playing the deck**\r\n\r\nThe deck is designed to be played mainly in Alter Ego, but you won't wan to be exclusively in Alter Ego as you need some charge counters (ideally 4 or more) to discount the cost of [Rogue](/card/37002). [Ready to Rumble](/card/21022) allows you to use Thief Extraordinaire even on turns that you go over to Hero side. I can't stress enough how important this ability is. The threat removed isn't always great but the ability to choose which card you put back on top of the encounter deck is huge, especially when the villain is confused. You can avoid [Advance](/card/01186) or cards like [Hela's Cloak](/card/21148) that would completely wreck your strategy, and remain in complete control of the game. That's also why [Crew Quarters](/card/20029) is a key piece here, letting you recover any damage you take in Hero form without exhausting, which would make you miss another Thief Extraordinaire opportunity. If you have plenty of HP left, you can couple [Crew Quarters](/card/20029) with [Weapon X](/card/35022) for an extra resource. \r\n\r\nAs you are using Thief Extraordinaire every turn, [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) is an incredible card too, even if you don't get the card draw it is still one threat off a scheme every turn. Fantastic value.\r\n\r\n**How to lose with this deck**\r\n\r\nAs a confuse lock deck, this is obviously weaker against Steady and Stalwart villains. It also takes a little while for the deck to thin out and give you reasonable certainty of a confuse every turn. Try to hold [Psylocke](/card/35013) on the bench for as long as possible and always use another source of confuse in preference to her.\r\n\r\nYou can also struggle if several minions come out of the deck at the same time. That's another reason why it is important to go into Hero at least once and build up a few charge counters so a fully charged [Royal Flush](/card/37007) is an option in cases like those.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a deck for control freaks. With Confuse and Thief Extraordinaire you can have a grip of every part of the game and just whittle the villain to nothing.","user_id":8703,"investigator_code":"37001a","investigator_name":"Gambit","slots":{"12033":3,"13016":1,"20029":1,"27046":1,"27047":1,"27055":1,"32019":1,"32048":1,"32051":1,"35013":1,"35022":1,"37002":1,"37003":1,"37004":1,"37005":1,"37006":3,"37007":2,"37008":2,"37009":2,"37010":2,"37030":1,"01056":3,"01083":1,"01084":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"04020":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":""},{"id":26644,"name":"Gambit-Aggressive Recycling","date_creation":"2023-03-06T14:50:32+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-06T14:50:32+00:00","description_md":"Built for a Multiplayer game (Sharing the Boot Camp with Cyclops Leadership).\r\nAn educated Remy recycles his molecular acceleration and Creole Charm, with a view to regular switching to make best use of confuse of AE abilities).","user_id":7874,"investigator_code":"37001a","investigator_name":"Gambit","slots":{"13016":1,"27046":1,"28014":3,"28017":1,"32019":1,"32020":1,"32042":1,"32047":2,"32049":1,"35013":1,"35014":1,"35016":2,"36026":1,"37002":1,"37003":1,"37004":1,"37005":1,"37006":3,"37007":2,"37008":2,"37009":2,"37010":2,"37021":3,"38019":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":"multiplayer"},{"id":26645,"name":"Gambit-Aggressive Recycling","date_creation":"2023-03-06T15:38:34+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-06T15:38:34+00:00","description_md":"Built for a Multiplayer game (Sharing the Boot Camp with Cyclops Leadership).\r\nAn educated Remy recycles his molecular acceleration and Creole Charm, with a view to regular switching to make best use of confuse of AE abilities).","user_id":7874,"investigator_code":"37001a","investigator_name":"Gambit","slots":{"13016":1,"28014":3,"32019":1,"32020":1,"32042":1,"32047":2,"32049":1,"33019":1,"33035":1,"35013":1,"35014":1,"35016":2,"36026":1,"37002":1,"37003":1,"37004":1,"37005":1,"37006":3,"37007":2,"37008":2,"37009":2,"37010":2,"37021":3,"38019":1,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"2.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}","tags":""},{"id":26646,"name":"Miles Morales explora el multiverso","date_creation":"2023-03-06T15:39:09+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-06T15:39:09+00:00","description_md":"Mazo preparado exclusivamente para jugar la campaña de Motivos siniestros.\r\nPocas cartas de liderazgo y muchas básicas pensando en sacar el máximo partido posible a los guerreros araña que hay en el juego.","user_id":13317,"investigator_code":"27030a","investigator_name":"Spider-Man","slots":{"12024":1,"13018":1,"13024":2,"27017":1,"27018":1,"27023":1,"27031":2,"27032":2,"27033":2,"27034":3,"27035":1,"27036":1,"27037":1,"27038":1,"27039":2,"27048":1,"27049":1,"28020":1,"29015":1,"30020":1,"30021":1,"01071":2,"01074":3,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"04016":1,"06032":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer"},{"id":26647,"name":"Rocket Raccoon Gets Justice","date_creation":"2023-03-06T16:52:47+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-06T16:52:47+00:00","description_md":"Rocket likes to do it all.

Introducing **[Vision](/card/26001a)**, The Scheme Destroyer Damage Soaking Tank.\r\n \r\nThe all-wise Android in his **[Intangible](/card/26002)** form cannot attack or defend, but all damage he receives, from each attack, is reduced by 2, which makes him a tank who can ignore all minions with 2 or less ATK (currently **78%** of all minions, including those from Nemesis packs. **Note**: Yes, Villainous minions might be problematic), but also this ability makes him limit the amount of damage received from Villain attacks. With such a powerful defensive capability, playing him in Protection is somewhat overlooked as he can shine on Justice and Leadership, but I think Protection might give him an ace up his sleeve.\r\n\r\n**All About Threat Control**\r\n\r\nIn **[Intangible](/card/26002)** form, all Vis can do in his turn is Thwart, and this deck will emphasize on that, leaving damage dealing to another player, until very specific turns, where a combination of cards might be used to deal a good chunk of damage. This means this deck is suited for Multiplayer, though at the end of the write-up I'll put up a few alternatives for true solo.\r\n\r\n**Starting Strategy**\r\n\r\nThere are a few key upgrades for this deck to shine, and thus a strong alternatives for a mulligan. **[Solar Gem](/card/26005)** should be your immediate priority, as it not only grants you an extra resource per turn, but also puts you in the Air, which is key for the ace up the sleeve I mentioned earlier. **[Deft Focus](/card/16024)** is another great card to key for at the start, as it'll make playing your signature events easier. Then, we're talking about less dire needs, but useful cards that go well together, like **[Endurance](/card/05023)** and **[Dauntless](/card/16016)**, which combined with the tanking ability of Vis can make you Retaliate for a long time. And **[Down Time](/card/05033)** that ensures you REC for 5 on Intangible and for a whopping 7! on Dense form. My initial mulligan would target for those cards, mainly. If you manage to get a few of them early in the game, you'll surely won't ever die. **[Vision's Cape](/card/26006)** is good as well, but situational, as we're gonna be staying for long on Intangible it's only worth it when you play a heavy stun/confuse scenario.\r\n\r\n**The Damage Soaking Tank**\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, Vision in Intangible form excels at soaking damage. When you're against stronger villains, **[Subdue](/card/19018)** will almost always ensure you receive no damage (unless a bad luck boost card), meanwhile **[Energy Barrier](/card/05017)** can help limit damage to 1 or 2 if unlucky, while also dealing a damage or taking down a tough. Against minions, you can almost always ignore them, except for those heavy hitters, for whom this deck has a couple copies of **[Pinned Down](/card/33034)** that can make you ignore them again, forever. Finally, if you're in trouble, 3 of the deck's 5 allies can soak up hits, **[Victor Mancha](/card/26015)** can soak up 2 or 3 if extremely lucky, while **[Jocasta](/card/26013)** and **[Ironheart](/card/13018)** can help once.\r\n\r\n**The Scheme Destroyer**\r\n\r\nYou will thwart for 2 every turn. EVERY turn (ok, except for a few exceptions), but you will have a lot of help as well. **[Just Passing Through](/card/26010)** might be one of the best thwart cards in the game, allowing you to bypass the Crisis icon and Patrol keyword, and with **[Deft Focus](/card/16024)** out, it's free to play. **[Solar Beam](/card/26008)** also benefits from Deft Focus, and allows you to thwart for 5, despite being a steeper cost. **[Vivian](/card/26003)** allows you to thwart for 6 (or 9 if you pair her with a **[Reboot](/card/26024)**), and **[Machine Man](/card/26022)** can thwart up to 12, given you can spend the resources to boost him. I would advice you don't chump block with them, unless you're in real trouble, or in Machine Man's case if you're up to 2 damage and prefer to use the resources on other things. Finally, **[Jocasta](/card/26013)** is helpful as well, with a 2-thwart and a block, albeit a bit expensive.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the ace under the sleeve. **[Ever Vigilant](/card/17030)** is the reason why I play this on Protection. Given you are Aerial, this card allows you to thwart for up to 6 in a turn, with 2 of those going to the Main Scheme, and the other 4 at free will. It aso allows you to combo with an ATK or two, (given you phase change), or a REC (given you flip to AE).\r\n\r\n**Flipping Down**\r\n\r\nOk, this is the elephant in the room. Flipping down to AE might be something you almost never want to do, surely with the thwart potential of this deck you can deal easily with a Villain SCH, but if you're surrounded by minions, this might amount to trouble, specially on main schemes with low thresholds. If you're running low on health, and in danger of dying, it might be wise to prepare for the flipping down turn. Taking care of minions might be hard on this deck, and you'll almost definetely need help from a damage dealing partner, but you can also use your events to deal some damage. The turn you plan on flipping down, it's wise you change to Dense form, use your basic Attack, if you manage to have **[Vivian](/card/26003)** out use her as well, then use either **[Superdense Strike](/card/26009)** and/or **[Solar Beam](/card/26008)** to take care of minions (yes, the latter is overkill and only needs to be used on an emergency, you're much better off using Superdense Strike). Now, how you'll be able to ensure you have your events in your hand you ask? **[Density Control](/card/26007)** is the key, as it'll allow you to fish out any Vision event from your discard pile when you change Mass Form. Make sure you have at least one (hopefully both) of them out before that turn.\r\n\r\nAlso, flipping down while in Dense form will boost your REC to 5 (7 if you have **[Down Time](/card/05033)** out), albeit at the cost of a 5-card hand (but the cost curve of this deck, makes this inconsequiential), so you'll probably need just one Villain Phase in AE to go back to full health. Then, prepare to thwart and thwart and thwart next turn (it might be wise, if possible to save one **[Density Control](/card/26007)** if possible to fish out **[Just Passing Through](/card/26010)** or keep one **[Solar Beam](/card/26008)** to thwart on the next turn.\r\n\r\n**Dealing Damage**\r\n\r\nKnowing when to rush is maybe one of the elite skills in Marvel Champions. In Vision's case (also real in Phoenix), converting the hero from a thwarting one to an attacking one makes him so fun to play. I've played this deck alongside a damage dealing partner, and I always manage to end the games with Vision dealing somewhere around 15 damage. The way to do this is detailed in the previous section, changing form, fishing out events and hopefully having Vivian out.\r\n\r\n**Rest of the Deck**\r\n\r\nThe only signature card you won't use much (or at all...) is **[Mass Increase](/card/26012)**, as you almost always either finish the game or are in Alter Ego when in Dense form.\r\n\r\nFrom the rest of the cards, **[Phase Disruption](/card/26011)** is super useful but situational, as it'll allow you to confuse the Villain (which will lead to flipping to AE even easier) and also will discard a Villain attachment, **[616 Hickory Branch Lane](/card/26004)** is great for fishing out Vivian, but again as you flip down so little is situational as well, and it's always good to have a **[Quincarrier](/card/08023)** out, making this low-cost deck even cheaper. I'm even thinking of cutting the 3 double resource cards, but that's for a v2.0 maybe.\r\n\r\n**Obligation and Nemesis**\r\n\r\nYes, the **[Obligation](/card/26028)** is a problem, as it'll command you to spend a turn in AE immediately. When this pops up and you're surrounded by minions is where this deck's Achilles Heel, I'd say. The good thing is that you can quickly and easily deal with it forever.\r\n\r\n**[Ultron](/card/26029)** is super dangerous as well, as his **[Scheme](/card/26030)** will put the **[Ultron Drones](/card/26031)** environment into play, and thus every attack from Ultron, despite not dealing damage will rid you of one of your cards and put another minion against you. Killing Ultron is a priority when he comes out. I've got to say that if **[Dauntless](/card/16016)** is active, you'll kill all minions for free if you stay in Hero and Intangible form.\r\n\r\n**Playing True Solo**\r\n\r\nAs I said above, this deck is intended for multiplayer purposes and I think it  shines as a threat controller, paired with a damage dealing hero. But if you're playing true solo, you might need a bit of help.\r\n\r\n**[Nova](/card/05012)** is a must-include. He will help in dealing damage and with a high number of **<span class=\"icon-energy\"></span>** resources, he might help in killing minions, so keeping him on the Board might be useful. **[Luke Cage](/card/01076)** is expensive, but can deal a lot of damage. **[Protector](/card/26014)** is also useful, as you can pair him with any of your resource generators to get 3 ATK for 1 consequential damage, and also is a target for **[Reboot](/card/26024)**. I think that's what you could add, unfortunately most of the useful events have the Attack keyword and thus cannot be used on Intangible form. I'd remove **[Jocasta](/card/26013)**, **[Victor Mancha](/card/26015)** and **[Ironheart](/card/13018)**.\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful thinking of other Basic cards to add, I didn't look much at them during this writeup.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Versión en Español**\r\n\r\n\r\nAsí que me cuentas que existe un Héroe que puede controlar el Tablero a su antojo y ser inmortal? Presentando a **[Vision](/card/26001a)**, El Tanque Absorbe Daño Destructor de Planes.\r\n \r\nEl Androide Sabelotodo, en su forma **[Intangible](/card/26002)** no puede atacar ni defender, pero todo el daño que recibe, de todos los ataques, es reducido por 2, lo que lo convierte en un tanque, que derechamente puede ignorar a todos los Esbirros con 2 ATQ o menos (actualmente el **78%** de todos los Esbirros, Incluyendo los de los packs de Archienemigos. **Nota**: Si, los Esbirros con Infame pueden ser problemáticos), así como también limitar el daño producido por los ataques del Villano. Con esa capacidad defensiva tan poderosa, jugarlo en Protección es mirado en menos a veces, ya que es una bestia en Justicia y Liderazgo, pero en mi opinión, Protección le da un As bajo la manga.\r\n\r\n**Maestro Controlando la Amenaza**\r\n\r\nEn su forma **[Intangible](/card/26002)**, Vis sólo puede Interceptar en su turno, y este mazo va a enfocarse en eso, dejando los ataques para otro jugador, salvo en turnos muy específicos, donde cierta combinación de cartas le permitan hacer mucho daño. Esto significa que este mazo está pensado para ser jugado en Multijugador principalmente. Igual, al final de esta reseña, pondré algunas cartas alternativas para jugar con 1 sólo héroe.\r\n\r\n**Estrategia Inicial**\r\n\r\nHay algunas mejoras claves para que este mazo brille, y por ende son objetivos importantes de cara a la mano inicial y por lo tanto a su renovación. **[Gema Solar](/card/26005)** es tu primera prioridad, no sólo porque te entrega un recurso extra por turno, sino porque también te permite ser aéreo, lo que es clave para el As bajo la manga que hablé anteriormente. **[Concentración Eficaz](/card/16024)** es otra carta muy buena para apuntar al comienzo, ya que hará que juegues tus eventos propietarios más fácilmente. Después, en prioridades más bajas, hay dos cartas que trabajan muy bien en equipo, **[Aguante](/card/05023)** e **[Intrépido](/card/16016)**, ya que combinado con las capacidades de Tanque de Vis te van a dar Represalia 1 durante gran parte de la partida. Y **[Tomarse un Respiro](/card/05033)** asegura que te puedas REC por 5 en Intangible y por un increíble 7! en Denso. Mi renovación de mano apuntaría a esas cartas, prioritariamente. Si logras tener en juego algunas de ellas temprano en la partida, te aseguro que no morirás. **[Capa de la Visión](/card/26006)** es una buena mejora también, pero es sumamente situacional, ya que vamos a pasar gran parte de la partida en Intangible, por lo que es sólo útil en escenarios donde el Villano/Esbirros te dejen mucho en Aturdido o Confundido.\r\n\r\n**El Tanque Absorbe Daño**\r\n\r\nComo dije anteriormente, Vision en Intangible es un tanque absorbiendo el daño. Incluso cuando peleas contra un Villano fuerte, **[Sometimiento](/card/19018)** normalmente va a asegurarte de no recibir daño (salvo muy mala suerte con la carta de aumento), mientras que **[Barrera de Energía](/card/05017)** va a ayudar a limitar el daño a 1 o 2 puntos de daño si tienes mala suerte, al mismo tiempo que entrega 1 daño o quita un Duro. Al pelear con Esbirros, la verdad es que puedes ignorarlos largamente, excepto por esos que tengan más de 2 ATQ, en cuyo caso este mazo tiene un par de copias de **[Retenido](/card/33034)** que te pueden hacer ignorarlos para siempre. Finalmente, si de verdad estás en problemas, 3 de los Aliados del mazo pueden ayudarte a bloquear, **[Victor Mancha](/card/26015)** puede absorber 2 o 3 ataques (con mucha suerte), mientas que **[Yocasta](/card/26013)** e **[Ironheart](/card/13018)** pueden recibir uno.\r\n\r\n**El Destuctor de Planes**\r\n\r\nVas a INT por 2 todos los turnos. TODOS los turnos (ok, excepto por algunas excepciones), pero asímismo tendrás también un montón de ayuda para esto. **[Pasar a Través](/card/26010)** puede ser una de las mejoras cartas de INT del juego, ya que te permite ignorar el ícono de Crisis y Patrulla, y con **[Concentración Eficaz](/card/16024)** abajo, es gratis! **[Rayo Solar](/card/26008)** también se beneficia de Concentración Eficaz, y te permite eliminar 5 de amenaza, pero a un precio más elevado. **[Vivian](/card/26003)** te permite quitar 6 de amenaza (o 9 si tienes un **[Reinicio](/card/26024)**), y **[Hombre Máquina](/card/26022)** puede quitar hasta 12 de amenaza, siempre y cuando tengas los recursos para aumentarlo. Yo recomendaría no bloquear con ellos, salvo que estés en problemas o si a Hombre Máquina le queda 1 de vida y no quieres gastar más recursos. Para terminar, **[Yocasta](/card/26013)** Es útil también, quitando 2 de amenaza, pero es un poco cara quizás.\r\n\r\nY ahora, el As bajo la manga. **[Vigilancia Constante](/card/17030)** es la razón que me hizo jugar a Vision en Protección. Si estás Aéreo, esta carta te permite quitar hasta 6 de amenaza en un turno, con 2 obligatoriamente yendo al plan principal y los otros 4 a tu arbitrio. También podrías combinar con un ATQ (si cambias de fase) o con un REC (si te vuelves a Alter Ego).\r\n\r\n**Girar a Alter Ego**\r\n\r\nOk, este es el Elefante en la habitación. Girar a Alter Ego va a ser algo que jamás querrás hacer. Seguro, con el potencial de INT que tiene este mazo, vas a poder lidiar sin probelas con el PLA de un Villano, pero si estás rodeado de Esbirros, la verdad te puedes complicar mucho, especialmente en Planes Principales con bajos límites de Amenaza. Si estás con la vida muy baja y en peligro de morir, puede ser útil prepararse para ese turno en el que pasarás en Alter ego. Reducir el número de los Esbirros puede ser difícil con este mazo y seguro necesitarás ayuda de tu compañero de partida, pero también puedes usar algunos de tus Eventos para hacer daño. El turno en que te planifiques para irte Alter ego, es sensato cambiarte a Denso, usar tu ataque básico y si tienes la suerte de tener a **[Vivian](/card/26003)** abajo, atacar con ella también y luego usar **[Golpe Superdenso](/card/26009)** y/o **[Rayo Solar](/card/26008)** para destruir Esbirros (si, Rayo Solar es excesivo y caro, sólo para uso en emergencias diría yo). Ahorarabien, cómo nos aseguramos de tener esos eventos en tu mano, preguntarás? **[Conrol de la Densidad](/card/26007)** es la clave, ya que te permite \"pescar\" un evento de Vision de la pila de descartes al cambiarte de fase. Asegúrate de tener al menos uno (ojalá los dos...) antes de ese turno.\r\n\r\nTambién, girarte a Alter Ego cuando estás en forma Denso, aumenta tu REC a 5 (7 si tienes **[Tomarse un Respiro](/card/05033)** abajo), con la desventaja de una mano de 5 cartas en Alter Ego (la curva de costo de este mazo es tan baja, que esto no es terrible), por lo que lo más probable es que sólo necesites un turno en Alter Ego para volver a tu vida completa. Después, prepárate para interceptar, interceptar e interceptar en el siguiente turno (quizás es sensato guardar un **[Conrol de la Densidad](/card/26007)** si es posible y \"pescar\" un **[Pasar a Través](/card/26010)** o guardar un **[Rayo Solar](/card/26008)** para interceptar en el siguiente turno.\r\n\r\n**Haciendo Daño**\r\n\r\nSaber cuando hacer el \"rush\" es una de las habilidades de elite en Marvel Champions. En el caso de Vision (y también por ejemplo en Phoenix), convertir tu héroe de uno que intercepta a uno que ataca lo hace tan divertido de jugar. He jugado con este mazo en conjunto a otro héroe que se encarga del ataque y siempre termino finalizando las partidas con Vision haciendo 15 de daño aproximadamente y matando al Villano. La forma de hacer esto es la misma que expliqué en la sección anterior, cambiar de forma, sacar los eventos de la pila de descartes y ojalá contar con Vivian en el tablero.\r\n\r\n**Resto del Mazo**\r\n\r\nLa única carta de Vision que probablemente no uses mucho (o nada...) es **[Aumento de Masa](/card/26012)**, ya que casi siempre o finalizarás la partida o estarás en Alter Ego al estar en forma Denso.\r\n\r\nDel resto de las cartas del mazo, **[Disrupción de Fase](/card/26011)** es súper útil, pero situacional, te va a permitir Confundir al Villano (lo que ayudará cuando tengas que ir a Alter Ego) y descartar una Mejora del Villano, **[616 de la Calle Hickory Branch](/card/26004)** es muy buena para poner en juego a Vivian, pero estás tan poco en Alter Ego que también es situacional y finalmente siempre es útil tener un **[Quintransporte](/card/08023)** abajo, lo que hace que este mazo tan barato, sea aún más eficiente. De hecho, estoy pensando en cortar los 3 recursos dobles, pero eso es para otra versión del mazo, no para ahora.\r\n\r\n**Obligación y Archienemigo**\r\n\r\nSi, la **[Obligación](/card/26028)** es un problema, ya que te obligará a pasar un turno en Alter Ego inmediatamente, sin poder prepararte. Cuando sale y estás rodeado por Esbirros, yo diría que puede ser el Talón de Aquiles de este mazo. Lo bueno, es que es fácil y rápido de lidiar y se va para siempre.\r\n\r\n**[Ultron](/card/26029)** es muy peligroso también, ya que su **[Plan](/card/26030)** pone en juego el Ambiente **[Drones de Ultrón](/card/26031)**, lo que hace que cada ataque de Ultron, aun cuándo no te haga recibir daño, te va a quitar una carta de tu mazo y pondrá otro Esbirro contra ti. Esto hace que matar a Ultron sea la primera priordad cuando salga.Ojo, que si tienes **[Intrépido](/card/16016)** activo, vas a matar a todos los Esbirros Drones gratis si te mantienes en Intangible.\r\n\r\n**Jugando Sin Otros Héroes**\r\n\r\nComo dije, este mazo está diseñado para jugar en multijugador y brilla como el controlador de la amenaza del tablero, en pareja con otro héroe que se encargue de hacer daño. Por lo que si estás jugando realmente sólo, necesitarás ayuda y modificar un poco el mazo.\r\n\r\n**[Nova](/card/05012)** tiene que estar en el mazo para jugar sólo. Va a ayudarte un montón haciendo daño y con muchos recursos **<span class=\"icon-energy\"></span>** va a hacer mucho daño a los Esbirros por lo que mantenerlo en el tablero es muy positivo. **[Luke Cage](/card/01076)** es caro, pero hace mucho daño. **[Protectora](/card/26014)** también es muy útil, ya que si la emparejas con uno de tus generadores de recursos, va a tener ATQ 3 y sólo 1 daño consecuencial, así como también es un buen target para **[Reinicio](/card/26024)**. Creo que eso es lo más que podrías agregar, ya que ninguno de los eventos son compatibles con Intangible. Los que saldrían del mazo, serían **[Yocasta](/card/26013)**, **[Victor Mancha](/card/26015)** and **[Ironheart](/card/13018)**.\r\n\r\nPodría ser interesante revisar otras cartas Básicas para agregar, la verdad no lo he hecho al momento de escribir este artículo.","user_id":22569,"investigator_code":"26001a","investigator_name":"Vision","slots":{"13018":1,"16016":1,"16024":1,"17030":3,"19018":3,"26002":1,"26003":1,"26004":1,"26005":1,"26006":1,"26007":2,"26008":3,"26009":2,"26010":2,"26011":1,"26012":1,"26013":1,"26015":1,"26022":1,"26024":2,"33034":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"05017":3,"05023":1,"05033":1,"08023":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":"multiplayer, theme"},{"id":26653,"name":"Rogue: Supreme Sorcerer Spider","date_creation":"2023-03-06T18:43:00+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-07T00:30:06+00:00","description_md":"The goal of this deck is to use Web Warrior trait and a touch ;) of Sorcerer Supreme","user_id":6188,"investigator_code":"38001a","investigator_name":"Rogue","slots":{"27010":1,"27011":1,"27012":1,"27018":1,"27023":1,"27048":1,"27049":1,"30020":1,"30021":1,"31015":1,"31017":3,"31020":3,"31022":1,"32049":1,"37021":3,"38002":1,"38003":1,"38004":1,"38005":3,"38006":3,"38007":2,"38008":2,"38009":3,"01079":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"09013":1,"09026":1},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}","tags":""},{"id":26654,"name":"Viuda Negra Desafio Dientes de Sable","date_creation":"2023-03-06T19:36:46+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-18T12:04:47+00:00","description_md":"Mazo con el que se realizó el desafío de vencer a [Dientes de Sable](/card/32061) en **Experto**.\r\n\r\nPodemos ver la partida y la descripción del mazo en el siguiente enlace\r\n[![Podemos ver la partida y la descripción del mazo en el siguiente enlace](https://img.youtube.com/vi/QFHSq9VbzKE/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/QFHSq9VbzKE)","user_id":15388,"investigator_code":"08001a","investigator_name":"Black Widow","slots":{"10029":3,"22011":1,"27046":1,"32019":1,"35032":1,"01058":1,"01062":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01092":1,"05023":1,"06031":1,"08002":1,"08003":2,"08004":2,"08005":1,"08006":2,"08007":2,"08008":2,"08009":1,"08010":2,"08011":1,"08017":2,"08018":3,"08024":2,"08033":3},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":"solo, multiplayer, theme"},{"id":26655,"name":"Spider-Man Justice Expert Heroic 1 Updated","date_creation":"2023-03-06T20:32:25+00:00","date_update":"2023-03-07T09:23:14+00:00","description_md":"spider man","user_id":21168,"investigator_code":"01001a","investigator_name":"Spider-Man","slots":{"10029":1,"01002":1,"01003":2,"01004":2,"01005":3,"01006":1,"01007":2,"01008":2,"01009":2,"01058":1,"01059":1,"01060":3,"01062":2,"01063":1,"01065":1,"01083":1,"01084":1,"01086":2,"01088":1,"01089":1,"01090":1,"01091":1,"01092":1,"05023":1,"05031":3,"06031":2},"ignoreDeckLimitSlots":null,"version":"1.0","meta":"{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}","tags":""}]]
