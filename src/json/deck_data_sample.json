"date_update": "2023-02-15T00:27:12+00:00", "description_md": "I was having a lot of fun with a Nova Aggression [Honed Technique](/card/28017) deck with [Dive Bomb](/card/17028), [Into the Fray](/card/13013), and [Melee](/card/05030) until I ran into Ronan's bunny face on the [Universal Weapon](/card/16109) card as he beat me to a pulp in the fourth round.  Now Sam is leporiphobic and won't get out of bed, so it's time to take advantage of the worst combo break in Marvel Champions and get Nova back in action.\r\n\r\nStrategy:  Mulligan all cards for [Ms. Marvel](/card/28002) and [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) (GFC).  Nothing on her card says the damage is required to be paid for the response, so playing the card nullifies the damage, and Kamala will get it back in your hand for only the cost of her exhaustion.  Each turn you pay 3 resources on GFC to protect all of the Champions in an infinite loop.  \r\n\r\nThis sounds broken, but you have to survive to setup, and even then you can lose while paying 3 resources every turn to avoid damage.  This deck is made to survive four to five rounds versus insanely difficult villains in case a setup card is on the bottom of your deck.  After setup, you must thwart and attack enough to win before threatening out.  And Ronan is still dangerous if you aren't paying attention.  I've lost to him with this deck, but then again, Ronan expert is insane.  Try hero difficulty if you're just as insane.\r\n\r\nIf a needed card is at the bottom of your deck, there are extra allies to chump block and draw cards, [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012), [Ironheart](/card/13018), and [Nick Fury](/card/01084).  You can also defend and use [Ever Vigilant](/card/17030) (EV) to ready and draw another helmet resource.  [Champions Mobile Bunker](/card/28020) adds flexibility and helps setup, a great card if you remember to use it when you need to.  Surviving the setup is the only exciting part of this deck.  Afterward, you're just torturing the villain.  This deck isn't meant to be fun; it's payback to over-the-top difficult villains.\r\n\r\n[Med Team](/card/01080) will help keep Sam alive and put him over 10 HP for other benefits, but use [The Night Nurse](/card/09019) if you need to remove status cards from a hero while fighting a different villain. \r\n\r\n[Pinpoint](/card/29035) will shuffle in cards like [Fighting Fit](/card/16014), [Unleash Nova Force](/card/28006), or [Pot Shot](/card/28005) every turn.  [Moon Girl](/card/28018) or optionally [Snowguard](/card/29023) will attack or thwart every round not taking damage due to GFC.  After setup, those two allies and [Ms. Marvel](/card/28002) should stay out for the rest of the game.  \r\n\r\nVersus scheming, [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017) will constantly remove up to three threat, and you can use [Lightspeed Flight](/card/28004) for side schemes.  [Bait and Switch](/card/15030) is an overpowered card with GFC.  \r\n\r\nIf Nova readies with [Unleash Nova Force](/card/28006) or EV, his basic power attack can help with removing a tough status.  I would change out three events with 3 [Beat 'Em Up](/card/14032) cards if the scenario has multiple enemies with toughs or lots of low HP enemies as Ultron does.\r\n\r\n[Endurance](/card/05023) allows [Dauntless](/card/16016) and [Fighting Fit](/card/16014) to be used.  With this deck, Nova should defend the villain's attack every round to draw a card using [Unflappable](/card/09020), to remove up to three threat with [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017), and to retaliate up to 2 with [Dauntless](/card/16016) and [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031).\r\n\r\nSeven wild cards and [Supernova Helmet](/card/28009) help maximize Nova's event card damage so that he can destroy scenarios and still pay for GFC.  [Forcefield Projection](/card/28003) isn't as efficient as [Pot Shot](/card/28005), so it is used less due to the resources needed for GFC or more efficient attacks. \r\n\r\nSome good cards that I chose not to use:  [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091) creates tempo loss but could be swapped with [Helicarrier](/card/01092) or both dropped; at hero-difficulty, I prefer more events for board control.  [Deft Focus](/card/16024) won't get much use due to wilds being counted as 2 resources, but I could see it added just for [Unleash Nova Force](/card/28006).  [Team-Building Exercise](/card/12024) isn't efficient with the chosen allies and you may not need allies if you setup quickly.\r\n\r\nThis GFC strategy isn't new, but hopefully you find some new ideas in here.\r\n\r\n-Stretch\r\n\r\nA fun Hulk deck that actually beats moderate expert villains is my next obsession.

Several cards came out obviously designed to fix him, though I'm holding out for a 3-cost Gamma card that lets him draw a card after each attack that successfully causes him damage.  How many of us have gone through the exercise of trying to fix Hulk's design?\r\n\r\nI was sad to see \"the most powerful Avenger\" dismissed for his poor flexibility and poor thwart, so I did some math.  Bruce just needed to dump the resources and pump up the upgrades and events.  He stands up now, and boy is smashing fun!\r\n\r\nI try to stay thematic to all hero decks that I build, but with Hulk, I became desperate to find something that worked.  There's a justice deck with 1-cost thwarts that works, but that wasn't thematic; I had to stick to aggression.  I have 3 [Hand Cannon](/card/16046)s in this build, and they're essential for the overkill and benefit to [Moment of Triumph](/card/12030), so I pretend that I'm playing Smart Hulk.  They're so essential that if I were to play without them, I would house-rule my Gamma card above.\r\n\r\nEdit: Replace Martial Prowess used only for Crushing Blows with Enhanced Physique to fuel Hulk events.\r\n\r\nStrategy:  Mulligan for up to two of three resource generators, [Helicarrier](/card/01092), [Quincarrier](/card/08023), and/or [Deft Focus](/card/16024).  Take hits to the face using [\"You'll Pay for That!\"](/card/10016) to remove threat.  Then bring out [Hand Cannon](/card/16046)s to supplement [Moment of Triumph](/card/12030)s strikes to minions for big heals.  Make [Sub-Orbital Leap](/card/10004) a higher priority than it should be despite the cost.  Flip down only when you need to heal.  Obviously, smash!  \r\n\r\n[Blade](/card/21019) will attack when you have a strength resource left in your hand, and [Bug](/card/16040) will thwart when you can use a basic attack to heal him.  Both stay out for the whole game unless you have to block with them to survive.  Bring out [Lockjaw](/card/05018) from discard to block when you have more resources in hand than event card cost. \r\n\r\nThis build has a plethora of upgrades, but you don't need to prioritize any except [Combat Training](/card/01057).  I tried to find a solution using a [Honed Technique](/card/28017) deck or minion focused [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) deck like Thor's, but Hulk works best with a simple high attack stat manipulated into thwarting and healing. \r\n\r\nYour plays will be based on your status, the board, and the puzzle of your hand, which is why this deck is so much fun.  Maximizing four cards knowing that you can't keep any adds nicely to the tension.\r\n\r\nSome good cards that I chose not to use:  [Counterattack](/card/08030) has a fantastic value versus heavy damage strikes, but Hulk's kit needs more threat mitigation than extra damage.  [Fluid Motion](/card/28016) is also a great card but eventually cut for the same reason.  [Machine Man](/card/26022) counters Hulk's enraged flaw but ditto.  I prefer [Plan B](/card/27024)'s consistency to avoid enraged discards.  I wouldn't add [Side Holster](/card/20021) to try to get all three [Hand Cannon](/card/16046)s up at once, since these cards run off charge counters.  That card's designed for Rocket and my bestie Venom.\r\n\r\n-Stretch\r\n\r\nPuny god", "user_id": 31190, "investigator_code": "10001a", "investigator_name": "Hulk", "slots": {"01057": 1, "01090": 1,

Stomp](/card/12003). [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047) boosts all of [Giant Stomp](/card/12003). Let's bring it together! You can get up to 4 damage to each minion, 11 to a single enemy at it\u2019s peak. \r\n\r\nDive Bomb has higher potential, but requires you to be both Aerial and have [Honed Technique](/card/28017) out, and it costs 1 more resource. \r\n\r\nWhat you get in the trade off, however, is not needing to build around HT, allowing you more freedom in a build. Also\u2026Antoinette wasn\u2019t available to give Scott Aerial so we work with what we have!\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk combos:\r\n\r\n- [Swarm Tactics](/card/12020) has two allies to trigger the team up (both Wasps) making it more reliable to trigger\r\n- The wombo combo for [Giant Stomp](/card/12003) also works for [One by One](/card/28014)\r\n- [Army of Ants](/card/12007) is able to secure the kicker for [One by One](/card/28014) and overkill for [No Quarter](/card/28013). They are also free if you\u2019re in Tiny form with [Team-Building Exercise](/card/12024)\r\n- [No Quarter](/card/28013) could be swapped out for [Melee](/card/05030) in a really minion heavy scenario for a similar combo, but No Quarter is just so universally good and putting melee in would probably see you wanting to lean into a HT deck.  Nothing wrong with that, the combos works great in that as well!\r\n\r\nThanks for checking this out!", "user_id": 27264, "investigator_code": "12001a", "investigator_name": "Ant-Man", "slots":

The more attack these have the better [Fastball Special](/card/35023) and [Team Strike](/card/32045) and [Game Time](/card/33022) become. With [Wolverine](/card/32041)'s ability and [She-Hulk](/card/10013)'s health they should stick around the whole game. Due to the tough status cards you can take attacks with your hero instead.\r\n\r\nThis deck brings the [Attack Training](/card/32043) upgrade while the Storm deck has [Reinforced Suit](/card/12018) and [Uncanny X-Men](/card/36018). With these you can get She-Hulk up to 10 health, get some damage on her, which gives her ridiculous attack power from her ability.\r\n\r\n3 copies of [Brute Force](/card/14029) are used to boost Colossus as you can avoid ever needing to use a basic attack. Instead help with a basic intervene, or exhaust for [Team Strike](/card/32045) / [Smash the Problem](/card/25019).\r\n\r\nA few notes on playing, the main priority is to get [Wolverine](/card/32041) / [She-Hulk](/card/10013) / [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) out and some of Colossus' upgrade cards. Then you can start attacking with allies while waiting for [Fastball Special](/card/35023) or [Team Strike](/card/32045), just make sure they don't die. You want to flip to alter ego often to get more cards early on and use abilities of supports (from the Storm deck). It is also essential for gaining tough statuses, I find keeping/returning [Organic Steel](/card/32006) is important. Also, note that when you are getting low on cards in the deck you can be sure to draw [Armor Up](/card/32010) when you need it. Be careful using [Piotr's Studio](/card/32003) the first time you go through the deck as it can skip over some important cards. I tend to not use it until I have the key allies in play.\r\n\r\nI added 2 copies of [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) to help draw it when you need it. The 2nd copy can go on the Storm player so that she can keep the X-Men trait in alter-ego, which is sometimes useful with [Uncanny X-Men](/card/36018).\r\n\r\nAs Colossus does not have that many resources and 4 hero hand size, I did reduce the cost and setup a bit. This is why there is no [Combat Training](/card/01057) or [Boot Camp](/card/13016). I found that there was enough attack anyway, and fitting in [Game Time](/card/33022) was more important.\r\n\r\nThanks to journeyman2 for some useful feedback on the decks!", "user_id": 19578, "investigator_code": "32001a", "investigator_name": "Colossus", "slots": {"01055": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01092": 1, "10013": 1, "14029": 3, "25019": 2, "32002": 1, "32003": 1, "32004": 1, "32005": 1, "32006": 2, "32007": 2, "32008": 3, "32009": 2, "32010": 2, "32041": 1, "32043": 2, "32045": 2, "33020": 1, "33022": 3, "33035": 2, "35013": 1, "35014": 1, "35023": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": "multiplayer"}, {"id": 26176, "name": "Uncanny Teamwork - Storm", "date_creation": "2023-02-18T12:15:08+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-18T12:16:21+00:00", "description_md": "Lately I have been making some decks for multiplayer, trying to make some fun strategies that would not work in solo. This is the 2nd pair, which focusses on boosting the attack of Colossus and his allies. This half provides supports and upgrades, while also being able to put out plenty of thwart. You can find the Colossus aggression deck [here](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/26175/uncanny-teamwork-colossus-1.0).\r\n\r\nTo further increase the health of [She-Hulk](/card/10013) this deck includes [Reinforced Suit](/card/12018 and [Uncanny X-Men](/card/36018). [Sidearm](/card/23035) is actually super useful if dealing with a villain with retaliate. Then, Storm boosts the attack of everything with [Thunderstorm](/card/36004). \r\n\r\nThis deck includes some of the X-Men support cards. Both decks can have opportunities to switch to alter-ego so you should get plenty of uses. With [Danger Room](/card/33021) as long as one of the two heroes is in Alter-Ego, you can use it. For example, Storm is in Hero and plays an ally, Piotr in Alter-Ego can use [Danger Room](/card/33021) to attach an [Attack Training](/card/32043) from their deck. [X-Mansion](/card/36025) can keep allies around for longer and [Forge](/card/36022) helps to set up quicker. \r\n\r\nAs this deck may need to defend with allies you can make the most of the discount from [Uncanny X-Men](/card/36018). Or, if you are in alter-ego get an upgrade instead. Note that you lose the discount in alter-ego as you no longer have the X-Men trait. But, later on the Colossus deck can throw a spare copy of [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) on Storm to allow her to keep it.\r\n\r\nStorm brings plenty of threat removal from her own cards and is supported by allies boosted with [Danger Room Training](/card/33015). \r\n\r\nI only include X-Men allies to avoid losing the benefit of [Uncanny X-Men](/card/36018). There are not that many options in Leadership, which is why I added [Make the Call](/card/01071). [Make the Call](/card/01071) can actually get [Wolverine](/card/32041) or [She-Hulk](/card/10013) back if the Colossus deck could not play them the first time through their deck. You can still use Fastball Special if Wolverine is in play under Storm, but it does mean that Colossus would not be able to use the ally for [Team Strike](/card/32045).\r\n\r\nThanks to journeyman2 for some useful feedback on the decks!", "user_id": 19578, "investigator_code": "36001a", "investigator_name": "Storm", "slots": {"01071": 2, "01072": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "08031": 1, "12018": 1, "16024": 1, "23016": 1, "23035": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32049": 1, "33011": 1, "33015": 3, "33019": 1, "33021": 1, "36006": 1, "36007": 1, "36008": 1, "36009": 3, "36010": 3, "36011": 2, "36012": 2, "36013": 2, "36016": 1, "36017": 1, "36018": 2, "36022": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26177, "name": "Ham-on, and on, and on.", "date_creation": "2023-02-18T13:06:02+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-27T22:50:21+00:00", "description_md": "The [Spider-Man](/card/27049) ally in leadership can be used to get several hero attacks in one turn. With the Web-Warrior allies you can play [Warrior of the Great Web](/card/30029) on Spider-Ham, gaining an attack each time one leaves play. \r\n\r\nThis is based on a made a [Ghost-Spider leadership deck](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/21791/ready-again-50-damage-turns-2.0) that I made previously. Although this deck does not have [George Stacy](/card/27007) to store cards, it does have the benefit of more draw power and of course [Clarity of Purpose](/card/31029) with Spider-Ham's ability to gain resources. I find that Spider-Ham cannot quite hit as much damage at once, but with all of the extra resources can start the combo quite quickly.\r\n\r\nEarly on you can control the game with allies while you get the supports and upgrades out. I had seen similar Spider-Ham decks, but my version focusses more on the Web-Warrior allies. Besides Peter [Spider-Man](/card/27049) there is [SP//dr](/card//30021) who can be recycled every turn (play and attack one turn. Next turn, thwart, return to hand, play, attack again. Then repeat). This can also net you extra draws once you have [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023) out. Otto [Spider-Man](/card/31022) is cheap and can ready [Clarity of Purpose](/card/31029) again. Then Hobie [Spider-Man](/card/27017)  actually puts out a good amount of damage, particularly in more difficult scenarios. [Ghost-Spider](/card/27048) helps with fetching some of Spider-Ham's best events. With so many basic cards [The Power in All of Us](/card/13024) is great, which is why I round out the rest of the allies with some generally good basics. \r\n\r\nIt should not take too long to get the cards you need with all of the draws/resources you have. In the meantime you can avoid damage with [Cartoon Physics](/card/30009), or confuse and switch to alter-ego to heal up. \r\n\r\nFor the combo you basically need to have [Spider-Man](/card/27049), [Warrior of the Great Web](/card/30029), and [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023). Ideally you also want some other Web-Warrior allies out that already have damage, and a copy or two of [Command Team](/card/23016). \r\n\r\nYou start by defeating some allies with consequential damage to gain a draw and +1 attack. Hopefully this should put Spider-Ham onto at least 3-4 attack already. Then, you start attacking and simply keep readying [Spider-Man](/card/27049), and therefore Spider-Ham, with the leadership cards. If the ally dies that gives you more attack and a draw. Then, you bring Peter back with [Rapid Response](/card/08031), [Make the Call](/card/01071), or [Across the Spider-Verse](/card/27018). Spider-Ham often has spare resources, so you can actually get a second ally back from [Across the Spider-Verse](/card/27018) and trigger [Warrior of the Great Web](/card/30029) an extra time. Don't forget there is also an extra ready from [Organic Webbing](/card/30011) if you have it. Even getting 2-3 extra attacks will easily bring you up to 20 or so damage - enough to finish a villain stage! But, if you have all of the pieces out it can be even higher. \r\n\r\nSo, try it out, I think this is one of the best ways to really take advantage of the Web-Warrior cards!", "user_id": 19578, "investigator_code": "30001a", "investigator_name": "Spider-Ham", "slots": {"01069": 2, "01071": 2, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "08031": 2, "13018": 1, "13024": 2, "23016": 2, "27017": 1, "27018": 1, "27023": 1, "27048": 1, "27049": 1, "30002": 1, "30003": 2, "30004": 1, "30005": 1, "30006": 2, "30007": 3, "30008": 1, "30009": 2, "30010": 1, "30011": 1, "30021": 1, "30029": 1, "31022": 1, "31029": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26178, "name": "Ant-Man - Quantum Justice", "date_creation": "2023-02-18T16:43:56+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-20T03:31:11+00:00", "description_md": "# Ant-Man Quantum Justice\r\n\r\n> \"Why don't you pick on someone your own size?\" -  Scott Lang \r\n\r\nHello & welcome to Ant-Man Quantum Justice.\r\n\r\nIn this build we're going for a lot of readying our Hero-Modes using a bunch of newer cards.

Sobre todo para poder hacer uso de [Todos juntos](/card/21018) en su maximo potencial.\r\n\r\n- Hay una combinaci\u00f3n muy satisfactoria que uno puede prolongar toda la partida que es jugar a [Bestia](/card/33011) para recuperar recurso. Lo vamos utilizando y conservando un [Respuesta r\u00e1pida](/card/08031) para ponerlo en juego de nuevo volviendo, as\u00ed, a robar recursos.\r\n\r\nEn fin, lo dicho, un mazo muy elemental (querido Watson) pero funcional por un motivo muy sencillo, estamos  ante una aut\u00e9ntica lideresa: Tormenta.\r\n\r\nNOTA: Para multi con un grupo mutante es buena idea incluir tres copias de [Entrenamiento en la Sala de Peligro](/card/33015) para ir solt\u00e1ndola a aliados amigos.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH:\r\nIn addition to Storm's own mechanics, the deck is built around boosting two facets of ally-based play: increasing her life and drawing cards. It's something very classic and basic but it works with Tormenta and in what way...\r\n\r\nI leave you some key points for the deck that, on the other hand, are evident:\r\n\r\n- During the game before going fully to use the Storm cards, we will promote setting up a table with a good number of allies to be able to make use of them while keeping them on the table.\r\n\r\n- To increase the life of the allies we will use two cards [The impossible Patrol-X](/card/36018) and [Team Training](/card/04016) with which the allies will have two more life and we will increase their number to 4.\r\n\r\n- To draw cards with allies we will use the typical [Numerical Superiority](/card/03017).\r\n\r\n- You must always keep at least three allies on the table, leaving them with 1 life point until someone else takes over. Especially in order to make use of [All Together](/card/21018) to its fullest potential.\r\n\r\n- There is a very satisfying combination that one can prolong the whole game which is to play [Beast](/card/33011) to recover resource. We are using it and keeping a [Quick Response](/card/08031) to put it back into play, thus returning to steal resources.\r\n\r\nIn short, what has been said, a very elementary deck (dear Watson) but

I love these, and if you're clicking on decks with my name next to it, you probably do too!\r\n\r\n**Here's the play-by-play**:\r\n\r\n- Ms. Marvel makes a basic attack for 1 damage\r\n- [Repurpose](/card/31016) a 2-cost Tech and attack for 3\r\n- [Repurpose](/card/31016) a 2-cost Tech and attack for 5\r\n- [Repurpose](/card/31016) a 2-cost Tech and attack for 7\r\n- Defend an attack in the villain phase* \r\n- Respond to the attack with [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) for 7\r\n- *Morphogenetics* [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) back to hand\r\n- Play [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) for 7\r\n- Trigger [Indomitable](/card/01082) to ready\r\n- *Morphogenetics* [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) back to hand\r\n- Play [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) for 7\r\n- Trigger [Indomitable](/card/01082) #2 to ready\r\n- *Morphogenetics* [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) back to hand\r\n- Play [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) for 7\r\n- Trigger [Indomitable](/card/01082) #3 to ready\r\n- *Morphogenetics* [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) back to hand\r\n- Play [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) for 7\r\n- Play [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) #2 for 7\r\n- Play [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) #3 and Embiggen! it for 9\r\n\r\nPlaying [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) seven times(!!) for 51 damage and the 16 damage in basic attacks lands her at **67 damage**, before taking into account allies, [Plasma Pistol](/card/20022)s, [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031), and any [Big Hands](/card/05003). \r\n\r\nAll of this is perfectly legal, [Indomitable](/card/01082), [Counter-Punch](/card/01077), and *Morphogenetics* are all responses within the same window and can be triggered interchangeably until we close that window!\r\n\r\nCheck out the [FAQ on Ms. Marvel](https://hallofheroeslcg.com/official-ffg-rulings/#msmarvel)\r\n\r\n**This attack should be defended using [Defiance](/card/26018) or [Wiggle Room](/card/05005), making a basic defense will cost us 7 damage as we get one less use of Morphogenetics*\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://imgur.com/zL1cHKM.jpeg\">\r\n\r\n*\"Person of the Week in Every ~~Greek~~ Marvel opinion poll\"*\r\n\r\n\r\nHercules has his muses, and Ms. Marvel has [Bruno](/card/05007), [Aamir](/card/05006), and [Nakia](/card/05008). There are two main ways to set up the combo: Bruno and Aamir. Fry favors the latter and I favor the former!\r\n\r\n**Bruno method**: \r\n\r\n- Put x3 [Repurpose](/card/31016) and x3 [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) under [Bruno](/card/05007)\r\n- Hero phase, use [Bruno](/card/05007) to take the x3 [Repurpose](/card/31016) into hand but **do not use them**, hold all 3 into the next hero phase\r\n- Survive the villain phase\r\n- Next hero phase, pop all 3 [Repurpose](/card/31016)\r\n- [Bruno](/card/05007) the 3 [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) to hand\r\n- Defend the villain attack in the villain phase and drop the combo\r\n\r\n**Aamir method**:\r\n\r\n- Put x3 [Repurpose](/card/31016) under [Bruno Carrelli](/card/05007)\r\n- Stack the bottom of the deck with x3 [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) using [Aamir Khan](/card/05006)\r\n- Just before (or after) drawing into the [Counter-Punch](/card/01077)es, use [Bruno Carrelli](/card/05007) to draw the x3 [Repurpose](/card/31016)\r\n- Execute the combo\r\n\r\nPros of the Bruno method, are that it is relatively impervious to the encounter deck: there are fewer encounter cards that exhaust support cards (delaying Bruno) than there are that trigger a deck shuffle (ruining Aamir). Aamir limits the use of [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012) or *Teen Spirit*, as those will cause a shuffle or accidentally discard the Aamir cards when in need of an extra resource to set up the tech/[Indomitable](/card/01082)s. Hitting the end of the deck before the combo is set up is also a liability of the Aamir method.\r\n\r\nPros of the Aamir method, are that it takes fewer turns to set up the [Repurpose](/card/31016)s and [Counter-Punch](/card/01077)es, needing only two flips to alter-ego, whereas the Bruno method requires three. \r\n\r\nIt is a classic safety vs speed issue. Being familiar with both methods lets you evaluate the game state and spec into one direction or use a combination of both to achieve the desired ends!\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://media.tenor.com/bvI69jWUW24AAAAC/zero.gif\">\r\n\r\n*\"From appearance fees and royalties, our ~~Herc~~ Kamala had cash to burn\"*\r\n\r\n**All of the most important cards in the deck cost-0!** [Counter-Punch](/card/01077), [Defiance](/card/26018), [Repurpose](/card/31016), [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) amount to 11 costless cards, or about 35% of the deck!\r\n\r\nYou know what else has a lot of zeroes? This girl's bank account, Kamala is riiiiiich. Take the low-cost curve of the deck, the absurd number of alter-ego and hero resources, the incredible deck-thinning and it is a winning combination for her wallet. Her allowance must be huge!\r\n\r\n- **Alter-Ego Economy**:\r\n\r\n - *Teen Spirit*, [Aamir Khan](/card/05006), [Nakia Bahadir](/card/05008) on top of a 6-card hand is 9 resources. Flip up and gain access to [Biokinetic Polymer Suit](/card/05009) and *Morphogenetics* to get up to 11 resources on the turn.\r\n\r\n- **Hero Economy**: \r\n\r\n - *Morphogenetics* into double [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) to trigger [Unflappable](/card/09020), ending up with 7 cards in hand. Do everything from the previous paragraph, but in reverse, to end up with another 11 resource turn. \r\n\r\nGetting [Counter-Punch](/card/01077)es under [Bruno](/card/05007) are important to get them out of the deck and speed things up considerably. When combined with the deck cycling of *Teen Spirit*, she can get to a nice trim deck that cycles quick. [Aamir](/card/05006) is great to put double resources on the bottom, potentially in conjunction with [Energy Barrier](/card/05017)s and [Plasma Pistol](/card/20022)s discarded by *Teen Spirit*!\r\n\r\nGoing in I had my doubts, thinking this would be a slow, grueling combo to set-up, but it isn't! She sets up so fast it's practically just a [training montage](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwin2-SuwKT9AhVmMlkFHWjcBC8QtwJ6BAgLEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAopQB01y4zI&usg=AOvVaw3w-T2bIXuQuHCYlobPxwaQ)!! [Repurpose](/card/31016) decks are typically expensive, and this one is no exception. We need to get out x3 Tech and x3 [Indomitable](/card/01082), while also seeding [Bruno Carrelli](/card/05007) with 6 cards, totaling 21 ER of set up. That seems like a lot of setup, but when factoring in her 22 resources every other turn, it flies by! \r\n\r\nLess set up is necessary to OTK in 1p and 2p; a win can be mathed out on x number of [Counter-Punch](/card/01077)es, meaning skimping on some [Indomitable](/card/01082)s or [Bruno Carrelli](/card/05007) cards can result in a quick win. **This deck is so fast however, that it takes me longer to whip out my phone calculator, than to finish the setup!**\r\n\r\n- [Jocasta](/card/26013) is here to resume [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) chains or store a defense event for the OTK turn\r\n- [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012) can seek out an event to help with the board state or to put under [Bruno Carrelli](/card/05007)\r\n- [Professor X](/card/32019) helps generate free flips in solo\r\n- [Plasma Pistol](/card/20022) and [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) are the primary techs here, helping to control the board, pop toughs, and deal with those awkward moments where the villain hits for 4 but [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) only blocks 3. [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) can be crucial to block Retaliate on the OTK turn!\r\n- [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031) is a cheap [Repurpose](/card/31016) target in an emergency. The ping builds up over time, letting her get away with less set up, accelerating the villain health down while stockpiling damage under [Bruno](/card/05007). Eventually, villain health and damage stockpiled will cross like an Ark Nova end-game trigger!\r\n\r\n## **Zeroes that didn't become Heroes**\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://imgur.com/zhvZGsb.jpeg\">\r\n\r\n*No, not **this** Disney Hercules*\r\n\r\n- [Pinpoint](/card/29035) has great synergy with [Repurpose](/card/31016) decks...except this one. It saves most of its tech for the last turn, where [Pinpoint](/card/29035)'s interrupt is not needed. Triggering a shuffle can also ruin [Aamir Khan](/card/05006)\r\n- [Moon Girl](/card/28018) would be great...if there weren't so few <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> resources\r\n- [Forcefield Generator](/card/31019) can help hit some crazy numbers...but the forced interrupt prevents the use of [Wiggle Room](/card/05005)\r\n- [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) is a great slot in, particularly multiplayer where she can defend for multiple heroes that turn. It can also guarantee survival on the villain phase before the OTK turn, though it also shuts off [Wiggle Room](/card/05005)\r\n- [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014) is a multiplayer way to draw the first attack of the phase to Ms. Marvel on the OTK turn without sacrificing an exhaust/*Morphogenetics* trigger...but it has a chance to whiff if the villain pulls a 0-boost, while the lower cost of [Defiance](/card/26018) and [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) are preferred in other situations\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://prod-ripcut-delivery.disney-plus.net/v1/variant/disney/86BF4DCB71435B74BCAC93D369F38442E7159BBAA0124E1F521FF5F9DB4B8C84/scale?width=506&aspectRatio=2.00&format=jpeg\">\r\n\r\n*Hercules came out in 1997, Ms. Marvel's first appearance was in 2013 at age 16...16 years later. Making her \"birth year\" the same year Hercules released!*\r\n\r\n## **Ms. Marvel vs Others:**\r\n\r\nZero to Hero breaks a lot of conventions, not unlike Kamala did herself, so it wasn't immediately obvious why this combination works:\r\n\r\n- [Repurpose](/card/31016) in a 1/1/1 hero\r\n- [Repurpose](/card/31016) in a hero without kit or trait readies\r\n- Ms. Marvel without the usual attack/thwart event package\r\n- Ms. Marvel not in Aggression or Justice\r\n\r\nMy rule of thumb, up until Fry shattered it, was that [Repurpose](/card/31016) practically requires the ability to ready one or more times from cards that stay on the board like hero abilities (*Dizzying Reflexes*) or upgrades/supports/allies (like [Spider-Man](/card/27049)), which made Ghost-Spider so ideal. Zero to Hero proved to be the exception to the rule!\r\n\r\nThe more I played this deck, the more parallels I noticed with Ghost-Spider:\r\n\r\n- [Sneak By](/card/05004)+[Shrink](/card/05011) is a more flexible [Phantom Flip](/card/27004), while [Big Hands](/card/05003)+[Embiggen!](/card/05010) is a more flexible [Ghost Kick](/card/27002)\r\n- The \"spend a card to draw a card\" nature of [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) is reminiscent of [Web-Bracelet](/card/27009)\r\n- Both heroes can recur double resources, either [Ticket to the Multiverse](/card/27008) or with [Aamir](/card/05006)\r\n- Both heroes have a way to stash cards until needed in [Bruno](/card/05007) and [George](/card/27007)\r\n- But the key reason this deck works as the exception to the rule, is that *Morphogenetics* [Counter-Punch](/card/01077) may as well be an extra ready in the vein of *Dizzying Reflexes* or [Spider-Man](/card/27049)! \r\n\r\nWhere Gwen has high output, Kamala has high economy.

Build the suit and start blasting. \r\nYou should never be blocking because it is inefficient: you save one health and lose 2-3 thwart, or lose 2-4 health overall due to thwarting and being unable to recover. \r\nOnce everything is on the board the only important cards to keep in hand are any last set up pieces, Repulsor Blast, or Supersonic Punch. Everything else is fuel for the fire. \r\n\r\nAllies:\r\nQuake and Snowguard(3) for versatility and protecting yourself so you can stay in hero form as long as possible. Quake helps with early minion spam if you keep her around, and snowguard is amazing no matter which form you need. Typically you want the last one for more blocking that pings tough, but the damage and thwarting is situationally useful as well. Bonus that both are energy. War Machine should only be played if there is nothing better, and kept around as an emergency block so he does not clog the deck when cycling for damage.\r\n\r\nEvents:\r\nFoiled is extremely useful early and if the villain ever schemes in hero later. Meditation helps get as many set up pieces out early as possible, with the main targets being Pepper, Mark V Armor, and Sonic Rifle. Once you have Arc Reactor out you can use Meditation more liberally to play anything. Unfortunately, it becomes a dead card late game, but its worth losing 2 cards if you can get there as early as possible. Two against the world should only be played if you had discarded one of your upgrades, War machine should only be on the board at the very end. Yaw and Roll has really good synergy since you want to be aerial as much as possible, and the Helmet counts as a thwart and therefore procs the condition. \r\nAgain, once you have the suit, only your own events matter and the rest are fodder for the blast.\r\n\r\nSupport:\r\nNone of these are a priority, though Stark Tower is a good stopgap if you draw all of your upgrades at once. Quincarrier is the only addition due to versatility, unfortunately you cannot play it with Meditation. \r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nThe whole point of Iron Man. Get as much of the tech down as you can, the priority afterwards is:\r\nIngenuity (for permanent aerial)\r\nUnder Surveillance (for delaying the end)\r\nDown Time (recover is the only reason to go to alter ago outside of recycling upgrades after everything has been built out, making better recovery a priority as you won't be blocking anyway. This also means that you will be healing 10hp/flip allowing you to stay in hero longer)\r\nEndurance (Gets you to 20 Max Health)\r\nHeroic Intuition (You can throw this down if you get it early, but with how much thwart removal you have already its not necessary) \r\n\r\nCounterintellegence is situational and highly depends on the villain and side schemes. It becomes top priority if there is a crisis and you are going to end in alter ego, since it bypasses the crisis condition of being unable to remove threat from the main scheme. No threat is being placed there in the first place.\r\n\r\nSonic Rifle and Heroic Intuition can realistically be cut for more Counterintelligence, but the rifle acts as another tech that can be played with max efficiency from meditation; and I like shrinking the deck as much as possible with permanent upgrades to cycle attacks faster. It's why I prefer to keep the rifle out late so you're hitting max damage on blasts as often as possible. \r\n\r\nWhile this is not as fast as Protection at getting everything online, it presents its own challenge of juggling threat, playing with the suit itself, and making smart plays like the genius Tony is; instead of going out to save the world with a boot and two gloves, covered in energy shields like an electric wrecking ball.", "user_id": 28922, "investigator_code": "01029a", "investigator_name": "Iron Man", "slots": {"01030": 1, "01031": 3, "01032": 2, "01033": 1, "01034": 1, "01035": 1, "01036": 1, "01037": 1, "01038": 2, "01039": 2, "01065": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "05023": 1, "05033": 1, "06031": 1, "08012": 1, "08017": 1, "08023": 1, "09038": 3, "20015": 1, "20022": 3, "23024": 1, "26036": 2, "28026": 3, "29023": 1, "29027": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "3.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26229, "name": "Captain America Avenger Deck", "date_creation": "2023-02-20T19:04:50+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-20T19:04:50+00:00", "description_md": "This is my first Created Deck.

Eventually, [Embiggen!](/card/05010) will allow you to crush your enemies, either on defense with [Powerful Punch](/card/32014) (which seems to be my typical endgame scenario) or offensively with [Big Hands](/card/05003).  \r\n\r\nRepeated card draw with [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) is the key to dominance, especially when paired with [Unflappable](/card/09020).  Keep [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) constantly at hand or cycling back into it with [Pinpoint](/card/29035), [Jocasta](/card/26013), and [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012).  If possible, keep Pinpoint in play for the entire game to cycle back important cards, such as [Iron Fist](/card/09014), resource cards, [Wiggle Room](/card/05005), and [Jocasta](/card/26013).  \r\n\r\n[Iron Fist](/card/09014) will often contribute 16 points of damage against the villains in your first cycle through of your deck, along with stunning them 4 times, since [Pinpoint](/card/29035) can shuffle him back into your deck when he is discarded.  \r\n\r\nThe end game will typically be triggered once [Embiggen!](/card/05010) is in play and the Villain is in Stage III.  Powerful Punch and/or [Big Hands](/card/05003) will hand out huge damage to the villain and keep minions at bay, though one can often ignore the schemes and minions at this point while tearing through the villain.  \r\n\r\nWhen [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) is not yet available, [Side Step](/card/14015), [Jump Flip](/card/27014), and [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014) will keep damage at bay, or they can be paired with [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) to allow a copy of it to stay in your hand while managing main scheme threat (with [Jump Flip](/card/27014) or plinking the villain with damage (and controlling your own damage) with [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014).  [Flow Like Water](/card/26016) will add additional shots to accelerate the end game, though you do not have to rely on this card. \r\n\r\nThanks for the read!  I hope some people find this useful.

So I thought I'd try and build an X-Factor deck for Marvel Champions.\r\n\r\nTo my mind, [Quicksilver](/card/14001a) is the only X-Factor related Hero card we have at the moment, and although he doesn't have the trait, [Serval Industries](/card/14007) from his kit does.\r\n\r\n[Multiple Man](/card/14012) is a no-brainer, Madrox has to be in the deck, so we have to be playing Protection. [Warlock](/card/14013) is also X-Factor traited, so he's in the deck. Warlock hasn't appeared in the run I'm reading so far, but the run is long and there's other versions of the team. [Polaris](/card/32012) is also a Protection ally and has also been in the team at some point. She can only target herself with her ability, due to how the mutants seem to be being traited by team, but hey, a 3-cost ally with tough seems decent to me. Due to sticking to the theme, we're missing out on [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012), who I think would be good in this deck.\r\n\r\nThe main thrust of the deck is getting Quicksilver to activate multiple times, ideally with a stat boost. [Adrenaline Rush](/card/14022), [Civic Duty](/card/14023) and [Armored Vest](/card/01081) all boost stats, alongside the options already present in Quicksilver's kit.\r\n\r\nI flip-flopped on [Indomitable](/card/01082) because although Quicksilver can just ready himself most of the time, [Gang-Up](/card/01189) and [Assault](/card/01187) are cards that exist, so it seemed like a cheap way to mitigate being exhausted due to the villain making multiple attacks. It also helps keep Quicksilver going if you're defending for other players. [What Doesn't Kill Me](/card/27016) is a perfect card for Quicksilver, healing damage and giving you yet another bite at the cherry. Also, the Requirement can be met by [Friction Resistance](/card/14009).\r\n\r\n13 out of Quicksilver's 15 card set have the Superpower trait, so [Deft Focus](/card/16024) can reduce the cost of approximately 1/3 of the deck. [Always Be Running](/card/14003) costs 1, so with [Deft Focus](/card/16024) that's a free ready.\r\n\r\n[Order and Chaos](/card/14018) is very much the 41st card, here but the Team-Up cards are fun and so I've kept it in.\r\n\r\nIn solo, the deck is all about action advantage, making multiple attacks and thwarts and still defending each turn to frustrate the Villain.\r\n\r\nIn multiplayer, the deck is more about using cards like [Always Be Running](/card/14003), [Multiple Man](/card/14012), [Indomitable](/card/01082) and [What Doesn't Kill Me](/card/27016) to defend for as many of your fellow Heroes as possible, allowing them to focus on winning rather than what they do if they're attacked.\r\n\r\nHopefully there's more X-Factor stuff coming in future waves, given that the trait already exists in the game. Personally, I'd love to see a Multiple Man Hero (especially if he'd be able to play the [Multiple Man](/card/14012) ally and I could just fill the board with cards called Multiple Man).", "user_id": 1885, "investigator_code": "14001a", "investigator_name": "Quicksilver", "slots": {"01079": 2, "01081": 1, "01082": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "09020": 1, "10031": 1, "14002": 1, "14003": 4, "14004": 2, "14005": 2, "14006": 1, "14007": 1, "14008": 1, "14009": 1, "14010": 1, "14011": 1, "14012": 3, "14013": 1, "14018": 1, "14022": 3, "14023": 3, "16024": 1, "27016": 3, "32012": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26239, "name": "Scarlet Witch Justice vs. Loki Solo Champions League S14 R1", "date_creation": "2023-02-21T13:17:21+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-23T19:36:33+00:00", "description_md": "Nothing too fancy.

The two events that let you get that extra damage without taking the consequential damage are [Team Strike](/card/32045) and, you guessed it, [Fastball Special](/card/35023)\r\n\r\n## Setting up\r\n\r\n[Team Strike](/card/32045) is admittedly an awkward card to set up. You need to have wolverine ready, and your allies need to be alive and ready. The deck depends on wolverine's strong hero kit to keep minions/threat under control, and the every turn heal plus [Regenerative Healing](/card/02036) and [Adamantium Skeleton](/card/35004) to stay alive without too much chump blocking. [Professor X](/card/32019) is very helpful in buying turns for setup. If you can afford her, [Psylocke](/card/35013) is also great at buying time. [Clobber](/card/18012) is there for some emergency backup damage, and because it costs 2 health + 0 resources to play with wolverine.\r\n\r\n[Utopia](/card/33020) gives you a 4th ally slot and can give wolverine an extra basic activation. [Colossus](/card/32048) is the most important ally to get out. He also gets a free block with his tough! All the allies in this deck are x-men, so anytime you can play an [Attack Training](/card/32043) on someone, do it. [Enraged](/card/03031) should go on colossus first, and other allies second.\r\n\r\n[Boot Camp](/card/13016) is nice, but pretty expensive to get down. It's helpful if you get it down early to buff allies taking down minions, but late game, boot camp will only add 3-4 damage per team strike, or 1 damage per fastball special.\r\n\r\n## The big hits\r\n\r\n[Fastball Special](/card/35023) doesn't require Wolverine and Colossus to be ready. If everything is fully set up, it's 11 damage with overkill and piercing for 2 effective resource! Even with nothing set up, just Colossus sitting there, it's 5 for 2 ER, which is still good!\r\n\r\n[Team Strike](/card/32045) has a theoretical max of 21 damage with everything set up perfectly. More than likely it won't get fully set up, but this combo scales linearly with set up. A team strike that's 60% set up, will do about 60% of that damage. The cost is 2 ER plus you have to exhaust Wolverine and all the allies involved. It's the same damage as if everyone swung individually, but there's no consequential damage.\r\n\r\nTo think about it differently, a team strike where you exhaust Wolverine and 1 ally is effectively an ally heal of 1 damage (or 2 depending on the ally) for 2 ER. Not great value. If you exhaust 4 allies it's an ally heal of 4 damage. Better. If you count 2 enrages, its an ally heal of 6-7 health. Now we're talking!\r\n\r\nThe other cool thing about the team strike combo is it's non-destructive. Many big swing combos will spend multiple events or discard upgrades, and you have to set them up again if it wasn't lethal. Team strike is 1 card, and the allies stay on the table.

Pero me di cuenta que la intervenci\u00f3n era bastante escasa y ten\u00eda el problema de los esbirros d\u00e9biles, puesto que tenia pocos ataques de mucho da\u00f1o y depend\u00eda demasiado de sus [\u00a1Wakanda por siempre!](/card/01043a).\r\n\r\nEntonces pens\u00e9 en darle una vueltecita y sali\u00f3 este mazo que est\u00e1 basado en armas y aprovechar la t\u00e9cnica depurada con el [Lluvia de balas](/card/20026), aunque tambi\u00e9n tiene otros eventos que son muy aprovechables con T\u00e9cnica depurada. Sus armas propias no necesitan agotarse, por lo que son excelentes candidatas. Y si a\u00fan as\u00ed no tienes suficiente, el viejo [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019) confiable, aunque a mi gusto puede ser prescindible. Las tres copias de [Entrar en combate](/card/13013) son flexibles, puede cambiarse por otras cartas tipo [Momento triunfal](/card/12030) o [A por ellos](/card/01052) si no hay esbirros.\r\n\r\nLos aliados son mayormente para intervenir y confundir, aportando bastante estabilidad a este mazo en cuanto a intervenci\u00f3n, que era lo que m\u00e1s le flojeaba en iteraciones anteriores. Y en eso los mejores son los se\u00f1ores psionicos, [Profesor X](/card/32019) y [Mariposa Mental](/card/35013). Con estos aliados me he encontrado en varias ocasiones el plantearme quedarme dos turnos seguidos en Alter ego, sobre todo si est\u00e1 en mesa [La Ciudad Dorada](/card/01045).\r\n\r\n[Fuego Solar](/card/35014) es muy vers\u00e1til puesto que de base es un aliado de coste 2 con 2 de ATQ y si tienes la necesidad de quitar accesorios pesados que te obligan a agotarte y otra serie de maldades. [Hombre M\u00e1quina](/card/26022) no se queda atr\u00e1s, un aliado que siempre he dicho que est\u00e1 ahi para las emergencias y en un h\u00e9roe con tantos recursos, se puede dar que f\u00e1cilmente que intervenga de 3-4. Alguno dir\u00e1 que esto es una falla en la construcci\u00f3n del mazo y que simplemente tendr\u00eda que replantearme metiendo otras cartas. Pero eso son los haters que no saben lo bueno que es Aaron.\r\n\r\nComo es un mazo con [Sin cuartel](/card/28013), he preferido quitar [Energ\u00eda](/card/01088) por un [El poder de la agresividad](/card/01055), de manera que hubiese m\u00e1s cartas de agresividad y no excedernos en recursos. Se podr\u00eda llegar a plantear quitar el [Fuerza](/card/01090) por otra copia m\u00e1s, pero me parece demasiado puesto que las cartas rojas que tengo no son tan caras y hay propias y grises que hay que pagar.\r\n\r\nPor \u00faltimo, respecto a las cartas propias de Pantera. Salvo que el escenario te exija algo diferente, creo que [Garras de pantera](/card/01047) es la carta que deber\u00edas buscar en la preparaci\u00f3n, para habilitarte cuanto antes todas las cartas que necesitan armas. Aparte de eso, dir\u00eda que este mazo ha sido de los mazos que menos he priorizado sus mejoras propias. Creo que es prioritario bajar los aliados y los apoyos e ir tirando de los eventos Lluvia de balas y [Sin cuartel](/card/28013) para el da\u00f1o.\r\n\r\nPues eso ser\u00eda todo, \u00a1un saludo y mover ficha para todos!", "user_id": 20712, "investigator_code": "01040a", "investigator_name": "Black Panther", "slots": {"01041": 1, "01042": 1, "01043a": 1, "01043b": 1, "01043c": 1, "01043d": 2, "01044": 3, "01045": 1, "01046": 1, "01047": 1, "01048": 1, "01049": 1, "01055": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "05023": 1, "06015": 3, "06019": 1, "08023": 1, "09037": 3, "10018": 1, "13013": 3, "20026": 3, "26022": 1, "28013": 3, "28017": 1, "32019": 1, "35013": 1, "35014": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": "solo"}, {"id": 26244, "name": "Vision of Wakanda", "date_creation": "2023-02-21T17:19:04+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-21T17:19:04+00:00", "description_md": "Hey ! \r\n\r\nSomedays ago, i played Black Panther core set in leadership and Vision was really strong.\r\n\r\nI tried to upgrade this idea, with a deck only focus on this ally ! \r\n\r\n- Ironheart is just a blocker, and is quite thematic.\r\n\r\n- Call for Help is dedicated to Vision, and will help you to reach him fast \r\n\r\n- After Vision is installed and upgraded, ready him, hit or counter, treat him, again and again and again \u2026\r\n\r\n- Unleash Vision potential with The Quincarrier each turn ( or Innovation ! ) \r\n\r\n- R & D Lab could be replaced by lead from the front or Command Team\r\n\r\nHave fun with this crazy Vision of Wakanda !", "user_id": 4909, "investigator_code": "01040a", "investigator_name": "Black Panther", "slots": {"01041": 1, "01042": 1, "01043a": 1, "01043b": 1, "01043c": 1, "01043d": 2, "01044": 3, "01045": 1, "01046": 1, "01047": 1, "01048": 1, "01049": 1, "01068": 1, "01069": 3, "01072": 2, "01074": 1, "01086": 3, "01088": 1, "01091": 1, "04015": 1, "08023": 1, "12015": 3, "12018": 1, "13018": 1, "21058": 1, "26024": 3, "29020": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26245, "name": "Cyclops leader of X-Men", "date_creation": "2023-02-21T18:07:31+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-21T18:07:31+00:00", "description_md": "Deck with the aim of puts allies on your board as much you can.\r\nAlso, [Ataque coordinado](/card/33016) helps to keep your allies fighting against minions", "user_id": 10006, "investigator_code": "33001a", "investigator_name": "Cyclops", "slots": {"01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "08031": 1, "32011": 1, "32012": 1, "32020": 1, "32041": 1, "32042": 1, "33002": 1, "33003": 1, "33004": 1, "33005": 2, "33006": 2, "33007": 2, "33008": 1, "33009": 2, "33010": 3, "33011": 1, "33016": 3, "33018": 2, "33020": 1, "33023": 1, "35014": 1, "36014": 1, "36015": 1, "36016": 1, "36017": 1, "36018": 1, "36022": 1, "36026": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo"}, {"id": 26246, "name": "Phoenix psyonic Allly intervention", "date_creation": "2023-02-21T18:17:32+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-21T18:17:32+00:00", "description_md": "Allies twarting are the core of this deck helped by [Centro de mando](/card/35032) and [Entrenado para la misi\u00f3n](/card/34016) and [Control mental](/card/34009)\r\nMeanwhile you can release the power to attack villains and minions", "user_id": 10006, "investigator_code": "34001a", "investigator_name": "Phoenix", "slots": {"01065": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "05033": 1, "32049": 1, "33014": 1, "33021": 1, "33022": 3, "34002a": 1, "34003": 1, "34004": 1, "34005": 1, "34006": 1, "34007": 1, "34008": 1, "34009": 1, "34010": 2, "34011": 2, "34012": 2, "34013": 2, "34014": 1, "34015": 1, "34016": 3, "34017": 3, "34020": 2, "34021": 1, "34022": 1, "34035": 1, "35032": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26247, "name": "Groot Protection Battle Buddy", "date_creation": "2023-02-21T18:23:57+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-21T18:23:57+00:00", "description_md": "This version of Groot is designed to support another Hero ID who is using an ally based deck.

When we reached out to our sources we were told that most of this activity was because of a plant. A plant inside of SHIELD could be devastating to our national security, but the Daily Bugle is determined to get to the bottom of this. \r\n\r\nWhen we asked [Monica Chang](/card/27040) about this supposed plant within SHIELD she responded cryptically.\r\n\r\n> The plant in question is not seen as a threat,\r\n> we have [Surveillance Team](/card/01064)s providing around the clock watch\r\n> and so far they have mostly observed the plant\r\n> practicing [Meditation](/card/26036) with a [Deft Focus](/card/16024) on [Fertile Ground](/card/16007). Seeing his growth come to\r\n> [Fruition](/card/16002) has been remarkable.\r\n\r\nDuring our time outside of SHIELD HQ we noticed a few familiar faces dropping by, including [Nick Fury](/card/01084) who arrived via [Helicarrier](/card/01092). His arrival was brief but sources say he provided key resources before leaving. Later a source reportedly saw [Agent Coulson](/card/08011) make an appearance and was said to be grilling the plant on [Espionage](/card/08033), but the source was unsure how the plant responded.  It was around this time that we started to get word of an [Overwatch](/card/30019) being established around the perimeter and heard rumors the plant was suspiciously going to be moved to the [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091).\r\n\r\nWhat we saw next shocked us all! An unknown villain was causing chaos nearby and a big sentient tree popped out of know where saving countless lives all the while being heard saying [\"I am Groot\"](/card/16003). Meanwhile the already well positioned SHIELD agents used their [Homeland Intervention](/card/27042) tactic to swoop in and thwart the villain's schemes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this provided enough cover for SHIELD to move their plant to a secure location maybe to the rumored Avengers, but from here the details of this unsavory character that was under dutiful watch of SHIELDS agents has completely dried up. Now the biggest question on everyone's mind is who is that giant talking tree and what can be done to stop it from hurting anyone. We reached out to [Professor X](/card/32019) for comment to explain how what we suspect is one of his mutant students could have escaped and put lives in danger. \r\n\r\n## Groot is a mega thwarter\r\n\r\n- He does need a little time to\u2026well grow, but nothing too significant. I\u2019d say this has a similar arc to Ironman and Iron Heart. \r\n- [Meditation](/card/26036) helps that growth a lot, and getting as many key SHIELD pieces in place while building growth counters is huge.\r\n- Get [Overwatch](/card/30019) onto the main when you see it. It is really going to maximize that big thwart turn\r\n- If you see [\"I am Groot\"](/card/16003) kinda early don't fret, hold onto it. It will pay off in the end. But if it ends up in your opening hand mulligan it. \r\n- try to replace whatever threat you are causing by being in AE. The SHIELD Package really helps with this and getting a confuse from [Professor X](/card/32019) plus 3 thwart...really really helps! You just need to buy a little bit of time. \r\n- Spending those few turns in AE also really helps you filter through your deck.\r\n- Best early targets: [Monica Chang](/card/27040), [Professor X](/card/32019), [Surveillance Team](/card/01064), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), [Sky-Destroyer](/card/27055). You really need to mulligan for 3/4 cost cards and start getting those rolling. \r\n- Unless it is Lockjaw, Lockjaw is here to provide a relief for hands where you have nothing otherwise. Groot really needs something to spend his cards on and I found he has a difficult time manufacturing that for himself, especially in hero form. Lockjaw provides an outlet for an otherwise wasted hand. \r\n- I view this as mostly a multiplayer deck! It could work solo as well, but there is a little bit of set up and friends certainly can help with. But for me this is a fun deck and one that can really impress those at the table with you as Groot pulls off a 26+ threat removed turn.", "user_id": 11440, "investigator_code": "16001a",

So you think Groot is a bit underpowerd too, huh? Well this deck probably won't fix that, but know that I built it with one purpose in mind: Keeping those darn Growth Counters on Groot and putting them to good use. Sure, having a ton of allies kinda defeats the purpose of having a hero in the first place, but I still wanted to try, and this is what I came up with using the packs at my disposal, so here goes nothing. Make sure to check the bottom of the page for a few variations.\r\n**\r\nCONTEXT:** _You were the chosen one!_\r\n\r\nWhen we finally got our hands on this hero, I was dead set on making Groot my main. Alas, I was very disapointed when I first played him. His growth mechanic is all over the place, taking any amount of damage spends counters, using the upgrades spends counters, your nemesis burns your counters... and to add insult to injury, only 5 cards in your entire deck add counters -appart from your AE action, and that's just 2 at a time. I couldn't believe my eyes, every past hero had been a joy to play, but not my beloved tree friend. So I came up with an idea: What if Groot NEVER spent his counters? So I packed his deck with as many allies as possible to prevent the villain from ever attacking my boy, and each ally sort of has a purpose here. But let's go over his other cards first:\r\n**\r\nEVENTS:** _Who is Groot?\r\n_\r\n\"I am Groot\" and \"I. AM. GROOT!\" are the stars of this deck (I really said that, huh?). Whenever Groot has more than 5 counters, these are the go to events that you should be looking out for, but that's not all. \"We are Groot\" is another standout, as it lets your allies tank one villain attack for free, and you can either choose to spend 3-4 counters on your allies and yourself , or spend just one on yourself to let your allies keep drowning the villain with endless ATK and THW. Be mindful of where your Groot events are, though, as you don't want to draw those while you have 1 or 2 counters on your hero. \r\n\r\nThere's not much to say about Fruition, use them unless you really need the resource or you already have 9-10 counters on Groot. Root Stomp, on the other hand, pairs well with your allies, ensuring that you get that sweet growth counter every time. However, if you're playing against a low-on-minions enconuter, you may forego them in favor of using something else.\r\n\r\nMake the call is the obvious choice here. Having access to cheap allies at all times is a blessing for any leadership deck, so don't be afraid to discard a couple allies early on.\r\n\r\nFlora and Fauna is optional, but I like to play themed decks. Plus the growth Counters are very nice. Feel free to remove it, though.\r\n\r\n**SUPPORT:**\r\n\r\nHere's where we find the standard cards that most decks can run. Avengers Mansion shouldn't be a priority due to its high cost, so save it until you can flip back to AE to get some counters and a bigger hand size. \r\n\r\nThe Helicarrier is here to cover up for Groots poor cost management, along with Deft Focus, and it should oviously be a priority. \r\n\r\nThe real kicker, though, is Fertile Ground, Groots other Counter Generator. Try to put this one in play as soon as possible, as it will fix Groots poor Counter generation, adn the extra draw is the reason why, even at full health, you'll want to flip to AE. just make sure to use up to 6 counters before you do, as you'll get those back for free (3 on the flip, 3 more next round).\r\n**\r\nUPGRADE:** _We need to be going up, not down!_\r\n\r\nThis section is self explanatory. Groots own upgrades are nice and may come in handy when we need that extra oomph, but we are mainly playing them to get them off the deck, giving us easier access to our allies and identity events. You specially don't want to use them when your deck is getting thin and you know an important Event card is coming up, so keep an eye on the discard pile. The magic numbers are 2 I am Groot, 2 I. AM. GROOT! and 1 We are Groot.\r\n\r\nRapid Response is also optional, although it has its uses. It will keep your allies on the board, covering Groots poor THW and lack of self-readying. Try to keep at least one in play at all times, choosing to spend them on your most valuable allies only.\r\n\r\nYou may opt to run Endurance and Down Time, but they're optional, so feel free to remove them in favor of something else entirely. Otherwise, play them under another player's control, as they might make a better use of them than you (I can spend the whole )\r\n\r\n**ALLIES:** _This is where the fun begins._\r\n\r\nAnt-Man is our filler ally. He's here to ATK/THW once and defend right after or just to defend. As such, feel free to spend 1-2 resources on him at maximum, he gets pretty average very quickly the more you spend on him and you want you ally roster to keep rotating. \r\n\r\nDrax is our right hand when dealing with the villain. His ATK is so high for a 3 cost ally that you may want to avoid defending with him entirely. Stinger used to be in this place, but then I realized that only Avenger heroes can play her, bummer.\r\n\r\nGamora is a must imo, as she will help with finding those sweet Identity Events for us, kind of like a tutor. Only use her basic abilities when you need an event asap. Try not to defend with her unless you really need to or your deck is running thin.\r\n\r\nIronheart does what Ironheart can: come in, draw a card, defend, Unless you're playing solo, her ATK/THW is nothing to write home about.\r\n\r\nLockjaw shoud be on the resources list tbh. Our good boy is meant to be used as a resource and act as a last resort ally that doesn't count toward your hand size. He really is a loyal dog.\r\n\r\nMaria Hill fills in that cheap THW ally spot. She's here mainly because I always play on multiplayer, and her card draw feels like Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\nMockingbird is optional unless you want to remove other allies from the list. That stun can prove to be invaluable when the villain gets a nasty upgrade. Other than that, she is a blocker. \r\n\r\nNick fury is best played early, when you need to get your setup out asap. There is a cool interaction between him and Rapid Response, though. If he dies defending you, Rapid Response will trigger, bringing him back into play and letting you draw 3 more cards plus another defense opportunity. Situational but cool.\r\n\r\nRocket is here for the fun. He allow us to play Flora and Fauna, and is super good at dealing with minions and side schemes, covering up for Groots shortcomings. \r\n\r\nYondu is usually a beast. Not here though. If you can keep him on the board, he will keep doing chip damage to the villain, removing TOUGH cards for free and avoiding retaliate tags. He's best played early. Otherwise, use him as resource. HOWEVER: If you swap a few cards here for Ally upgrades, be sure to attach them to him. \r\n\r\ninitially I had more random allies, but I chose to slot in a copuple more Guardians to make better use of Knowhere.\r\n\r\n**HOW TO PLAY:** \r\n\r\nWhatever suits your fancy, really. Yo may opt to go for a deep mulligan to try and get the big cards early on. Make sure to keep resource cards and allies just in case and dump the I am Groot events, as they don't provide any benefits early on. You may also want to stay in AE for a bit longer if you think you can contribute to the game through allies alone, as getting a couple more growth counters can prove to be very helpful. Just make sure to bring your THW allies first and use them to protect the other players. If you're playing solo, your allies can carry you through the early game, ensuring you get most of your set up as soon as possible. As always, shift your priorities according to the situation and bring in the ATK allies when you think you can rush the villain's health.\r\n\r\nGamora, Drax and Rocket are your key allies here, so go for them. Gamora is here to tutor your powerful events, so be mindful of how many you have already discarded before using her, otherwise ignore her if your deck is already very thin. Drax is a powerhouse, fillog in the lack of consistent damage to the villain. Rocket is here to play into the Flora and Fauna event, otherwise he is consistent at minion slaying and has a decent THW.\r\n\r\nAnother way to approach this deck it to keep rotating your allies, using them to protect you and other possible players left and right. Remember that allies aren't meant to live forever, and letting your Gamora die after only one use to bring in Mockingbird is just as good a tactic as any. Keep in mind that Lockjaw is just a failsafe, he's too expensive for what he does, so never play him form your hand unless you really need to or he's the first and only ally you draw.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Growth Counters, make sure you get more than you spend. Remember that removing two counters now to ready your hero when you could be dealing 10 damage with an I. AM. GROOT! for a total of 0 resources may not be worth it. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that ally based decks allow for frequent flipping into AE. This will ensure that your allies are not dying left and right. You WILL run out of allies, trust me. \r\n\r\n**VARIATIONS:** \r\n\r\nRemove whatever allies you think aren't that good and slot in a few ally upgrades. Just make sure that they aren't Avenger restricted.\r\n\r\nSwap most of your allies for a core of Yondu and Iron Man and bring a couple of Command Teams and 2 of each ally upgrade. Use We are Groot to keep Iron Man alive a bit longer.\r\n\r\nAternatively, you may remove knowhere and play a Call for Aid deck with only Avenger allies, ensuring that you always have something to defend yourself with.\r\n\r\n**SOME NOTES:**\r\n\r\nI know this deck isn't optimal, but I'm not one for building elaborate decks, so don't be too harsh, please. i know is that Groot is all about protecting others, not putting his allies in front of a Power Stone boosted slam from Ronan's hammer, but that's something I'm willing to overlook. This deck was born from my frustration of having to play Defense cards to keep the Growth Counters, only to find myself with little to no resources left for Groot's amazing events.\r\n\r\nLastly, excuse any language related mistakes, please, I'm not a native speaker and I'm mostly self-taught. Hope you have fun with this deck and make sure to let me know your ideas on how to improve it.

Not as bad as <a href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Madelyne_Pryor_(Earth-616)\">Madelyne Pryor's</a>. Yikes. We don't really have to get into all that. This deck is all about Jean though. I mean Cyclops is also there I guess, but Jean is what makes this strategy work. As such, it doesn't play well with another player using [Phoenix](/card/34001a), but it can work solo or in a group as a great support role that also dishes out a lot of damage and can have decent thwart spikes.\r\n<hr>\r\n<font size=\"5\">**Like a Phoenix, RISING FROM THE ASHES**</font><br><font size=\"1\"> Get it? Person named phoenix dies and resurrects a lot? *You* get it! It's funny. Please laugh it's all I have left.</font>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Opener**\r\n\r\nMulligan aggressively for [Phoenix](/card/33002) and also mulligan away any _**TACTIC**_ upgrades in your starting hand. You'll want them in the discard for later. You should then start the game by digging for any of your _**TACTIC**_ upgrades: [Exploit Weakness](/card/33005), [Practiced Defense](/card/33006), [Priority Target](/card/33007), or [Rapid Response](/card/08031). If you don't have a good target turn 1, just grab something you don't want to use as a resource. \r\n\r\nEventually, you'll want to build up an impressive engine so that every flip to Alter-Ego will provide a lot of value:\r\n- *Constant Training*: Cyke's Alter-Ego ability lets you grab any of the aforementioned _**TACTIC**_ upgrades to play or gain an extra resource.\r\n- [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018) gives you an additional card flipping back to Hero\r\n- [Weapon X](/card/35022) digs for Jean while also providing value, unlike [Cerebro](/card/34022). No matter what point in the game, you can find Jean, other important setup pieces like [Field Commander](/card/33004) or [Ruby Quartz Visor](/card/33003) or any of your quality events.\r\n- [Mutant Education](/card/37021) lets you shuffle your _**TACTIC**_ upgrades and other pieces back into your deck. When you're about to cycle your deck, be sure to shuffle Jean back in so you draw her right away. If not, prioritise other important pieces as you can always grab Jean from the discard. Shuffling _**TACTIC**_ upgrades ensures that *Constant Training* can always find something.\r\n- [X-Mansion](/card/32049) gives you an additional card when playing [Mutant Education](/card/37021) and heal yourself a bit. You won't really use it for Jean. She's too busy to go to class.\r\n\r\nOnce in Hero form, you're free to do so much.\r\n\r\n**Phoenix Loop(s)**\r\n\r\nPhoenix being the cornerstone of this deck provides a lot of avenues to victory. Here are some of the main patterns:\r\n\r\nSet up [Command Team](/card/23016) and use [Phoenix](/card/33002) several times so that she can be defeated. Then, resurrect with [Rapid Response](/card/08031). Alternatively, you can simply chump block with Phoenix. Just remember that she has to be defeated for Rapid Response to bring her back, but thankfully she enters play with a damage counter, allowing you to send her back to the discard even quicker than last time.\r\n\r\nThere are three copies of [Make the Call](/card/01071). You have up to three uses per deck loop. Then, when your deck is about to cycle, be sure to swap to Alter-Ego and shuffle her back in with [Mutant Education](/card/37021) so that you can draw her again quickly. If you have [Make the Call](/card/01071) in hand and need to defeat Jean, [Go Down Swinging](/card/23019) is available to discard her. Keep in mind that you can't trigger [Rapid Response](/card/08031) with GDS since it's a discard, not a defeat. Also keep in mind that you can grab GDS with [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010) if you need.\r\n\r\nEvery time [Phoenix](/card/33002) loops, you get to grab a Cyclops card from your discard pile. [Priority Target](/card/33007) turns on your *Optic Blast* ability and rewards you for defeating enemies. [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010) grabs even more tactics while thwarting. Grab [Field Commander](/card/33004) or [Ruby Quartz Visor](/card/33003) if they happen to be discarded. My absolute favourite though, and the main reason for this deck strategy, is [Full Blast](/card/33008).\r\n\r\n**Maximum Power**\r\n\r\n[Full Blast](/card/33008) is a great card. It's a single use card that requires a lot of hoops to jump through: upgrade on an enemy, exhausts your hero, a spare resource or [Ruby Quartz Visor](/card/33003). But the payoff is *immense*. Deal 11 damage to a single target, gaining piercing, ranged, and overkill (with all the relevant pieces in play). It discovers the Lost City of Atlantis. It divides by zero, locates the edge of the universe. Hell, this thing even does your taxes. With [Phoenix](/card/33002) you can grab Full Blast again and again, using it practically every round for the maximest of maximum value. [Utopia](/card/33020) is included to ensure that you are always ready when you need it. Unfortunately, you can't Full Blast more than once in a single round since you can only *Optic Blast* once per round, so you'll just have to settle for only doing 11 extra damage per round. I hope you can cope with this better than Scott coped with the Dark Phoenix saga.\r\n\r\n**More Cream Soda**\r\n\r\nThere are a few other nice things to toast to your victory and your enemy's inevitable demise. [Clarity of Purpose](/card/31029) is just an insanely broken card and honestly deserves to go in every single leadership deck. It's legitimately so difficult not to include it, but it doesn't have any intrinsic synergy, so while I won't forgive you for taking it out, I guess I can try to understand. [X-Mansion](/card/32049) easily heals off the maintenance damage, and Phoenix will chump block for you often anyway, but it's mainly for the extra card draw since we'll be studying up a lot with [Mutant Education](/card/37021). Also, [X-Gene](/card/38019) helps pay for all of your events. Full Blast is the star of the show and Tactical Brilliance can grab any _**TACTIC**_card from your discard, but [Ricochet Beam](/card/33009) is also very good, especially with [Exploit Weakness](/card/33005) (you can deal damage to the same target twice).\r\n\r\nAnd finally, [The Power of Leadership](/card/01072) helps to pay for all of your Leadership toys, like [Command Team](/card/23016)! And [Rapid Response](/card/08031)! Just those two things! But also keep in mind two things. One: Command Team can be used to ready any ally, not just Phoenix. Rapid Response is limit 1 per player, but you can crack one then play another. The Power of Leadership comes in really clutch for those turns where you might want to play more than one.\r\n\r\n**MORE SODA**\r\n\r\nIf you want to customise this deck for yourself, I have a few suggestions to keep in mind:\r\n- [Assess the Situation](/card/12033): I absolutely love this card, and it's a _**TACTIC**_ so it can be grabbed with [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010) (but not *Constant Training*). It's nice but not essential. You don't necessarily want to loop your deck too often unless you're digging for Jean since your discard is kind of an extra hand for you.\r\n- [Cerebro](/card/34022) is ok for helping to dig for Jean. It looks at the top 5 cards of your deck then shuffles if she's not there, increasing the chances that you find her on the next draw, but it never gives you any value unless you find Jean, so if she's already in play, it's a dead card unless you include more allies (see below).\r\n- [Save the Day](/card/23018): if you want some more thwarting power, include this. I prioritised [Go Down Swinging](/card/23019) because you will typically grab it with [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010), so you're already thwarting. GDS is also 0 cost so it's easier to play compared to StD.\r\n- [Sneak Attack](/card/23017): I actually don't like this for the deck because I'm not drawing Phoenix too often, but you could shift some of the focus to recycling the deck as much as possible, using [Assess the Situation](/card/12033), [Mutant Education](/card/37021) to shuffle in Jean, etc. and she'll get back into your hand more often. I just find that with more of a focus on that strategy, [Rapid Response](/card/08031) loses a lot of value, and there are no other allies in the deck.\r\n- Which brings me to the next point: more allies! If you want to have a little more consistency with allies, there are a few decent ones that can additionally help your deck function: [Beast](/card/33011) (hella resources), [Forge](/card/36022) (find those X-Men supports), [Maria Hill](/card/01067) (everyone loves cards), [Pixie](/card/36017) (MORE Jean; also works well with Sneak Attack), [Professor X](/card/32019) (so many modes to choose one, and they're all great), [Wolverine](/card/32041) (keep the love triangle alive).\r\n\r\n![JEAN!?](https://i.imgur.com/usCaMCj.jpeg)\r\n<font size=\"1\"> *Storm tries her best as Scott's wingwoman, but he has unrealistic expectations*</font>", "user_id": 5, "investigator_code": "33001a", "investigator_name": "Cyclops", "slots": {"01071": 3, "01072": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "08031": 3, "23016": 3, "23019": 2, "31029": 1, "32049": 1, "33002": 1, "33003": 1, "33004": 1, "33005": 2, "33006": 2, "33007": 2, "33008": 1, "33009": 2, "33010": 3, "33020": 1, "35022": 1, "37021": 3, "38018": 1, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26305, "name": "Scarlett Rouge", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T01:12:14+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-10T20:36:33+00:00", "description_md": "![scarlett](https://i.imgur.com/y1FZPg6.jpeg)\r\n*mfw: 'Hey, it's spelled Rogue!' for the fiftieth time*\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[Rouge Bleu](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/26321/touchin-me-touchin-blue-1.0) | Rouge Jaune | Rouge Vert\r\n\r\n**Straight from Moulin**\r\n\r\nRogue is here and packs a wallop. The way to play this deck is: wind up your attacks, get *all the minions*, put on your best Scarlett O'Hara unimpressed face, make *everything* gone with the wind, and celebrate with an [iced tea](/card/06017).\r\n\r\n**[Workin' Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnzkhQsmSag)**\r\n\r\nFeel the burn by building up your attacks with [Follow Through](/card/16045) and [Honed Technique](/card/28017). There's 21 cards in the deck with <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> resource icons, so y'all should have no problem gettin' those gains.\r\n\r\nY'all can also set up your resource generators: [Deft Focus](/card/16024), [Martial Prowess](/card/10018), and [X-Gene](/card/38019). Every card in Rogue's deck except for [Gambit](/card/38003) and [her jacket](/card/38004) are _**SUPERPOWER**_ and identity-specific events. Other than [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009), which is a 0-cost card, everything else works, so that's 10 really strong events that work at any point, regardless of how much you've set up anything else. [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) is also very important for the requirement on [No Quarter](/card/28013), so be sure to set it up. It's not impossible to pay otherwise, but it's less consistent than Honed Technique kickers, with only 16 cards with <span class=\"icon-physical\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>.\r\n\r\n**[Belle of the Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAS_Yx38nrA)**\r\n\r\nUse [Angela](/card/18011) and [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) to dig for minions. Once you have some in play, you can placed [Touched](/card/38002) one one of them, giving all your attacks Overkill. Remember to place it on the minion you wish to attack *last*, otherwise it goes away and you lose the Overkill. After placing it, be sure to use [\"Bring It!\"](/card/19030) if it's in your hand. Even at one minion, it's worth it. It's just a simple card cycle, letting you discard for another card. Don't save it in your hand for some crazy 10-card combo (I ain't your mama though, y'all can do what you want).\r\n\r\n**[Country Lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSMnrAJpEeo)**\r\n\r\nMy mama raised me in the dirty south a country ~~gentleman~~ lady. Down here, we make sure everyone who come to our house get fed. We're servin' up nothin' but knuckle sandwiches though (KAPOW!): [Into the Fray](/card/13013), [No Quarter](/card/28013), and [Southern Cross](/card/38006).\r\n- Into the Fray hits really hard, up to 12 total damage when you hit for excess with Honed Technique, and all of the excess gets to remove threat from the main scheme at the same time. With [Touched](/card/38002) on a minion, you're also hitting all that excess damage villain.\r\n- [No Quarter](/card/28013) similarly hits for 9 (with all the appropriate requirements), letting you discard from your deck for all points of excess damage and drawing all Aggression cards. Again with [Touched](/card/38002) on a minion, you get to hit all that excess to the villain at the same time. It's not uncommon to continually combo out minions. Your only limitation is minions, but thankfully you have so many ways to find new dance partners and keep the dance going all night. So raise a glass and toast to it!\r\n- Although [Southern Cross](/card/38006) doesn't benefit as highly, only hitting for 9 (with Follow Through) and just doing excess to the villain if Touched is on a minion, Deft Focus and X-Gene help pay for it, so it's a cheap date. Plus, it's helpful damage when you don't have any minions and just want to swing for value, getting a stun on the villain (if it's touched), extra damage (if it's on an ally), or draw a card (if playing multiplayer). If there's an _**AERIAL**_ character in play, you can attached Touched to it early in the round, then swap with [Energy Transfer](/card/38007), so it will hit for up to 11 and Overkill (with _**AERIAL**_, [Follow Through](/card/16045), and [Touched](/card/38002) being on a minion). That's a lot of steps, but we have to put some sweet combos in here somewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the easy guide to bein' a good 'ol southern lady.

I\u2019ve hit this a few times but even slugging the villain for 7 with one Punch is often able to clutch out a win.\r\n\r\n[Hard Knocks](/card/19016) is essentially guaranteed to give you a tough with a minion out, with a ceiling of 7 damage. Similarly, [Powerful Punch](/card/32014) hits for the same, able to take out a high hp minion or just chunk a lot of the villain, with an additional 1 from [Gambit's Staff](/card/37004). With the ruling on defeating an enemy with the punch, you could proc all your take no damage effects in case you hadn\u2019t proc\u2019ed them yet!\r\n\r\n[Judoka Skill](/card/38014) is so so good for Remy against the heavy hitting villains. [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017) shores up Gambit\u2019s meh thwart and [Not Today!](/card/38016) along with your allies keep those pesky side schemes under control.

The more resource generators we have, the higher our chance of seeing one or two of them early.\r\n\r\nMulligan hard for any of [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091), [The X-Jet](/card/32020), [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023), [Clarity of Purpose](/card/31029), [X-Gene](/card/38019) and [Deft Focus](/card/16024). [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) is also a very valuable card to look for!\r\n\r\n[Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023) is most important, but only if we have a Web-Warrior ally in hand we can also afford to play, followed by [X-Gene](/card/38019)! With that said, playing [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023) for its full cost is better than discarding it.\r\n\r\nGetting a Web-Warrior ally in the discard pile is very valuable, since we can cheat it into play through [Make the Call](/card/01071) which bypasses the need to have the Web-Warrior trait. This is how we set ourselves up to get [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023) in for free! And also how we start playing other Web-Warriors before we may have found it.\r\n\r\nAnd once we have one or two resource generators, the world is our oyster. Anything spare? Throw it into [Plan B](/card/27024)! Note that you do not need to play every resource generator in your deck, but with Rogue's high cost and the high card draw from this deck, your resource generators always have targets!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nNow we can afford anything we need, we can take full advantage of Rogue's events - and they are immensely powerful with status cards on demand as well as powerful damage and threat removal.\r\n\r\n- [Southern Cross](/card/38006) handles most minions. \r\n- [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005) handles most schemes.\r\n- [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) handles just about anything.\r\n\r\nAnd, once Gambit is out, you can use [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) when [Touched](/card/38002) is on him to grab any of those events you need! Or put [Touched](/card/38002) on a Web-Warrior while Gambit is still in play, and use [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) to grab [Beauty and the Thief](/card/37019) repeatedly from the discard pile!\r\n\r\nWith the card draw from [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023) and [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091), and the ability to use [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) like a Make the Call for events means that an amazing turn is practically always available.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to use your allies aggressively. The Web-Warriors are so good that you do not need to block with them, and with so many stuns, Tough status cards, heals, and confuses to go alter-ego and heal, Rogue barely needs them to block! Use [Go Down Swinging](/card/23019) if your army grows too huge from the powers of a recurrable [Across the Spider-Verse](/card/27018).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n**Good luck, have fun! :D** (And credit to Fry for helping with the Rogue-fied lyrics at the beginning!)\r\n\r\n<hr>", "user_id": 16053, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01071": 3, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "13024": 2, "16024": 1, "23019": 1, "27017": 1, "27018": 1, "27023": 1, "27024": 1, "27048": 1, "27049": 1, "30020": 1, "30021": 1, "31022": 1, "31029": 1, "32020": 1, "37019": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme, beginner"}, {"id": 26308, "name": "Go go go go go for Champions!", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T02:03:21+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-08T14:15:07+00:00", "description_md": "Rogue unlocks a ton of possibilities \u2013\u00a0every trait-locked card is accessible if you can attach [Touched](/card/38002) to a matching ally, and she can grab one-of events over and over with [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009).

With the extra activation from [Command Team](/card/23016), you can send her right to the [Med Lab](/card/38028), and between her and [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018), you're looking at an extra four cards after flipping to alter-ego. Not even Carol Danvers has that kind of card advantage.\r\n\r\nThis probably isn't Rogue's strongest deck, but it's one of the most fun decks I've played with and definitely shows off her unique skills in card access and recursion.

Rogue has been a really exciting hero for me, mostly due to her having a completely unique event in the form of [Superpower Absorbtion](/card/38009) (SpA). With proper setup, this card is essentially a Make the Call but for events, granting you tons of versatility with the proper allies. This deck aims to always have the three different classifications of allies on board (Identity Specific, Basic, and Aspect) so that we can essentially always grab the event we want.\r\n\r\nShout out to VillianTheory on the Marvel Champions LCG Discord for suggesting a SiN build to really make this concept shine!\r\n\r\nThis deck comfortably beat Expert Sabretooth and Magneto in Solo with the default mods, as well as Ultron with Brothers Grimm in a two-player game with Gambit-Aggression. This deck is currently low player count focused, but I will suggest alternatives later to help in higher player counts and when paired with a certain awkward partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Card 1: Rogue</strong><p/>\r\n\r\n\r\nRogue is decidedly an event based hero. She has 13 events, which her omnipresent upgrade Touched serves as a means of giving her unique characteristics like Retaliate, Aerial, and Overkill, and also lets her modulate the effects of her events. When touched is attached to the Gambit ally Rogue is able to use SpA to grab any of her effective events from the discard. Now, I know a big question is gonna be how you still use the status affliction parts of Rogue's events when you do this? The status affliction is definitely the eye-catching parts of Goin' Rogue and Southern Cross, and you can only Stun or Confuse when you have Retaliate, which comes from having Touched on the Villain. But we can work with that! Rouge's in kit Energy Transfer can be played to move Touched from Gambit to the Villain. With a single resource generator (we have several options in deck), we can play Energy Transfer and Going Rogue, and with two resource generators we can play Energy Transfer and Southern Cross. SpA is able to grab any of these events, so we're simply grabbing what we need to match what we already have. Energy Transfer itself is also just super good when resolved, especially with Rogue's Jacket! You might often still want to use SpA to grab Energy Transfer and put the Touched back on the villain anyway so that Bulletproof Belle is online. My final note on these is using SpA to grab an event and not having a way to move touched is still a great move pretty often, 4ER for 8 damage and 3ER for 5 threat removal are both great output. It is nice when Bulletproof Belle is able to be procced but it does not always need to be online when you throw out statuses and chump blocks as often as this deck does.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Card 2: Leadership </strong><p/>\r\n\r\nNow I know making decks that just add Strength In Numbers and are effective with that alone is nothing new. But this deck is encouraged to keep the board out even without SiN, and is very good at playing it in itself! Make the Call lets us grab whatever missing or removed allies we need to keep our Three-Card Monte. SiN is running well often with how stocked the board stays, and helps Rogue fill out economy when putting in late pieces of setup. Adam Warlock is one part of the Mystic Package and loves hanging around on the board for a while. Gaining his Aerial trait also can let us get multiple kickers from Rogues events if we use Energy Transfer after attaching to him. The second part of the Mystic package, Kaluu, is Rogue's biggest fan, definitely a mainstay for this Hero in Leadership. This deck plays 21 events and they're all amazing, so Kaluu's versatility in picking what we want helps with this decks philosophy. His effective cost is also very good to keep bringing back with Make the Call to chump block while still keeping a blue ally on board frequently.  Summoning Spell is a little clunky in the early game(especially when compared to true Mystic heroes) but our recursion is good enough that we can bring it back in the mid and late game and still use it to it's full effect and then some. It works out spectacularly that putting touched on our blue Mystic allies can let us use SpA to grab Summoning Spell and still have the Mystic Trait to play it right away. Clarity of Purpose is going to be another Rogue mainstay in Leadership, she loves cheap economy options. Make sure to use it to pay for Bulletproof Belle so that you don't run into any awkwardness with the tough status.\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Card 3: Basic</strong><p/>\r\n\r\nWe have plenty of good cards to play with using The Power in All of US. Angel and [Colossus](/card/35021) both being healthy allies for their cost are great for maintaining board, Forge helps us move setup along. Nick Fury is going to be a great ally to cycle through the deck, is spectacular when hit off Summoning Spell, and is a super flexible option off Make the Call. Utopia is great with Rogue with how effective her stats can be with her Jacket, and The X-Jet gets us more of that valuable economy. Same reasoning for Deft Focus and X-Gene, as well as The Sorcerer Supreme which is helped tremendously by MtC keeping mystics in rotation frequently. The reward for the Monte with gray cards is Beauty and the Thief, which we will practically always have online as we're preserving and recurring Gambit diligently. BatT and Rogues effective events make responding to Minions, Side Schemes, and playing from behind super easy, and very satisfying!\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Picks</strong><p/>\r\n\r\nMaria Hill is probably a surprising card to not see in a recursion heavy deck, but she is not a good Blue part of our Three-Card Monte since we cannot play a Summoning Spell from SpA if Touched is attached to her. I would definitely put her in for higher player count games, likely cutting a SiN which we can see often enough and is worse in the early game. Ironheart for Forge is also a good swap if you see your games going longer, since Forge will lose his effectiveness when Supports are all on board. Probably also a good decision in higher player count games when other players can help manage the early game as well. Finally, this deck is very different when playing with a Gambit hero! You'll obviously have to pivot to a Two-Card Monte here. I believe the deck should still function fine with just recurring BatT and your powerful blue cards often. However, with some experimentation and some modifications you can possibly include other powerful cards in the Basic part of the Monte. Iron Heart and another Basic Champion Ally make enough room to run Go for Champions! which can workout very well in multiplayer games. But that is currently only theory!\r\n\r\nRogue has been super fun in testing, and I hope everyone who plays this list enjoys!", "user_id": 14632, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01071": 3, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "03017": 3, "09026": 1, "13024": 2, "16024": 1, "17011": 1, "21014": 1, "21055": 1, "31029": 1, "32020": 1, "32048": 1, "33019": 1, "33020": 1, "36022": 1, "37019": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo"}, {"id": 26310, "name": "5 Card Creole Stud", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T03:01:20+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-26T21:07:40+00:00", "description_md": "Updated version below.\r\n\r\n[See V2.0 deck](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/26314/5-card-creole-stud-v2-0-1.0)", "user_id": 3779, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"05030": 3, "06017": 1, "10018": 1, "12030": 2, "13013": 2, "16024": 1, "18011": 1, "28014": 3, "28017": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32047": 2, "35013": 1, "35014": 1, "35016": 2, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37021": 1, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26311, "name": "Gambit et ses amis", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T04:18:05+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-24T04:18:05+00:00", "description_md": "my first draft of gambit and his amazing friends.  taking him to a mojo campaign this weekend and will post more about how it goes.", "user_id": 29924, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01069": 2, "01071": 2, "01072": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "04016": 1, "08031": 1, "12018": 2, "32019": 1, "32048": 1, "32049": 1, "33011": 1, "33019": 1, "33020": 1, "35033": 1, "36014": 1, "36015": 1, "36016": 1, "36017": 1, "36018": 1, "36022": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "multiplayer"}, {"id": 26313, "name": "Casino Heist", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T04:50:29+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-24T04:59:45+00:00", "description_md": "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UFMs3zA.jpeg\" alt=\"Gambit\"style=\"width:300px;height:300px;\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThis deck was designed to fully realize the potential of Gambit's alter ego ability using it to command a team of specialists to rob schemes of their threat\r\n\r\n[Full Deck Breakdown Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb1eMwm7fS8)\r\n\r\n**Getting the Team Back Together**\r\n\r\nA large part of this decks power lies in its flexibility and most of that flexibility comes from its allies. Each serves an important role on your crack team of heist operatives. [Blindfold](/card/33014) gathers intel, allowing you to more effectively use _Thief Extraordinaire_. [Forge](/card/36022) and [Monica Chang](/card/27040) work behind the scenes to provide you with important setup cards. [Dazzler](/card/37012) serves as a persistent distraction by confusing the villain, and [Rogue](/card/37002) is your muscle; she can always protect you or your teammates from casino security (the villain).\r\n\r\n**Tools of the Trade**\r\n\r\nA heist isn't complete without gear and this is no exception. Most of your time will be spent in Alter Ego using cards like [Breaking and Entering](/card/37015), [Creole Charmer](/card/37009), and [Homeland Intervention](/card/27042) to \"steal\" threat while you use [Global Logistics](/card/27043) to set up your _Thief Extraordinaire_ ability and [Mutant Education](/card/37021) to recover [Rogue](/card/37002) and important Gambit cards like [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) and [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010). [Chance Encounter](/card/26034) can also be used to find important allies early or to recover them and put them back into play.\r\n\r\n**Double Crossed!**\r\n\r\nAs I've said before, most of your time will be spent in AE while playing this deck, however, if you feel that it is necessary to blow your cover and go to hero form, that is also something it can handle. In fact going to hero form allows you to soak up some damage for your team, as well as use _Charge de Card_ to store up charge counters in order to make [Rogue](/card/37002) easier to play.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a lot of fun theory crafting this deck concept, and hope you have as much fun playing it!", "user_id": 16957, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01064": 3, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "06031": 1, "26034": 2, "27040": 1, "27042": 3, "27043": 3, "27055": 1, "32049": 1, "33014": 1, "36022": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37012": 1, "37015": 2, "37021": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "2.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": "multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26314, "name": "5 Card Stud", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T05:01:25+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-13T15:16:00+00:00", "description_md": "_Edit: publishing a second version as the first one had a couple of incorrect cards and amendments to the deck that needed making, and as there\u2019s no way to delete published decks\u2026_\r\n\r\nAt long last! My favourite superhero enters the Champions arena. Gambit, the Ragin\u2019 Cajun, and all-round stud is here! I havn't been this excited for a character in a long time. What has struck me most is that Gambit\u2019s deck doesn\u2019t do just one thing, and it sort of pulls in a few different directions; I could easily see myself playing him in Protection, Justice or Aggression. It\u2019s the later that I\u2019ve decided to focus on. \r\n\r\n**Deck basis and hero cards:**\r\n\r\nHaving seen his hero kit, with his Charge de Card ability, and other means of adding card charges to him I thought he would be akin to Ms Marvel in that he wants to play multi-attack events to capitalise on this ability. There are several ways of gaining these charges, through his Hero action, [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010) resource card and [Natural Agility](/card/37008) (this particular card playing well with [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005) to let him defend with his naturally high Defence and potentially ready up for another defence). Amassing these also makes his ally [Rogue](/card/37002) cheaper, and pound for pound, she\u2019s one of the best allies in the game (decent stats, Toughness and being able to be played for free? Yowzah).\r\n\r\n[Charged Card](/card/37006) and [Royal Flush](/card/37007) also play off these charges, and the later\u2019s multi-attack is where we will lean further into the Aspect cards.\r\n\r\n**Aggression:**\r\n\r\nThe first cards added were [One by One](/card/28014) and [Melee](/card/05030). Both have been fantastic in Ms Marvel, and work well here with Remy\u2019s charges. The next, and obvious, cards to add are [Warrior Skill](/card/35016) and [Honed Technique](/card/28017). Both add extra damage to these multi-damage events, and being able to trigger both at once can lead to some incredibly powerful attacks.\r\n\r\nTo add to this, I\u2019ve forgone the usual [The Power of Aggression](/card/01055) and added [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047) instead, as this deals extra damage when paying for Aggression events. \r\n\r\nNow, this deck works wonderfully with minion heavy decks, but it\u2019s not always a sure fire thing. I\u2019ve added [Angela](/card/18011) and a couple of copies of [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) in for some insurance. Gambit can struggle a bit with resources, so getting a free ally out who also fuels the deck is perfect! Looking for trouble does the same thing in digging out those minions but also helps us keep that threat down on the main scheme. As we\u2019re also trying to keep the threat on the main scheme down whilst also pounding minions, [Into the Fray](/card/13013) is a no-brainer. Being able to increase the damage dealt to much higher proportions can lead to some great turns removing as much as 10+ threat off the main scheme.\r\n\r\nFinally, adding in [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) then lets us capitalise on killing minions with some much needed card draw. [Psylocke](/card/35013) is there to give some much-needed relief in Alter-ego turns. The last ally spot is a bit of a flex, as [Sunfire](/card/35014) only costs 2, has 2 Attack and can chump block, but also has a real handy ability for some of those more annoying villains (looking at you, Sabretooth). You could easily swap him out for whatever the scenario calls for.\r\n\r\n**Basic:**\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s not too much in the way of basic aspect cards in the deck. [The X-Jet](/card/32020) helps provide resources for those turns we want to fuel Honed Technique. [Professor X](/card/32019) is there to again provide some AE relief, but also help keep threat down and throw himself under the bus as needed. \r\n\r\nSure, this deck plays very similarly to Ms Marvel. But I like that he\u2019s a wee bit more flexible in that he can defend well for himself, and there\u2019s a slightly higher ceiling for his charges to do more damage than [Embiggen!](/card/05010), or for you to spread them out over multiple event cards in a turn. I\u2019ve had a lot of fun with this deck, and it can work in multiplayer or solo. I\u2019ve played it in 3 player games (usually with Cyclops Leadership and Shadowcat Justice) where there\u2019s usually plenty of minions. When playing solo, I tend to take out at least one copy of Melee and swap it for another of Into The Fray, and maybe even squeeze in a couple of copies of [Chase Them Down](/card/01052).\r\n\r\nThis deck is far from perfect, and I\u2019m still honing it as I speak. It\u2019s a little bit slower for setting up Honed Technique etc as opposed to the Aggression deck that plays more off Gambit\u2019s signature events. That said, I\u2019m having immense fun.

True to form, Rogue has a dizzying number of deck options thanks to her unique ability to copy card traits with [Touched](/card/38002)-- she can basically be any type of character that you want! You can utilize Rogue as an Avenger, Web-Warrior, Champion, etc. just by playing the right allies and copying their traits, or copying other players/their allies in multiplayer (not to mention that Rogue is already an X-Men character, and they're terrific). Rogue's identity-specific events let her be an amazing generalist, and this particular deck leans into her event-heavy side by sending her to magic school.\r\n\r\nThe main idea here is to play the [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026), which will give Rogue a bigger hand size in hero form and increase the number of good events you're grabbing, as well as getting more resources to pay for them. Rogue doesn't get many benefits from swapping over to alter-ego, so this lets you maximize the time you spend in hero mode. In order to play [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026), you need to have the Mystic trait. You can steal that from two of your allies ([Clea](/card/09013) and [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012), who are solid allies in their own right), from other player character/allies in multiplayer, or from certain villains (e.g. Spiral). \r\n\r\nAmong your other allies, you've also got [Gambit](/card/38003), [Multiple Man](/card/14012), and [Professor X](/card/37017). Jamie and Chuck are there for their general utility, and can be swapped out for many other good options.  Gambit is your identity-specific ally and he's 1) amazing just the way he is, 2) gives you a ton of utility thanks to [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009), which will let you go fish for your powerful Rogue events when you attach Touched to Gambit. You want to play Remy as soon as you draw him and keep him alive as long as possible-- till death do they part!\r\n\r\nFor resource generation, you've got [The X-Jet](/card/32020) (an amazing card for any X-Men character), [X-Gene](/card/38019) (to get more resources for your many Rogue events) and [Deft Focus](/card/16024)-- all of Rogue's identity-specific events are Superpowers, so you'll get a TON use out of Deft Focus. Just keep in mind that while X-Jet and X-Gene can be used in player or villain phase, Deft Focus is a Hero Action so you'll need to be in player phase to use it. \r\n\r\nFor your Protection events, [Bait and Switch](/card/32015) is great cause sometimes you want the villain to attack you in player phase so you can use all those nice Defense events you'll be drawing (special shout-out to [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008)). [Desperate Defense](/card/16013), [Never Back Down](/card/14014) and [Not Today!](/card/38016) are all solid as well.\r\n\r\n_Other cards:_\r\n\r\n[Dauntless](/card/16016) is here because it's the only card that gives you Retaliate with no downside (and doesn't require you to be playing in multiplayer with Storm, though if that's an option, go for it!). Having Retaliate lets you do some good ping damage throughout the game and trigger status effects on [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005) and [Southern Cross](/card/38006), your two best events. Not necessary, but it's really fun when it works and between [Endurance](/card/36026)/[Energy Transfer](/card/38007)/allies/defense events, it's not too hard to stay in the HP range to make it work. You can also attach [Touched](/card/38002) to the villain to get retaliate in a pinch, but you usually do that at the cost of not getting Stalwart or Aerial.\r\n\r\n[Unflappable](/card/38013) is just free occasional card draw. Definitely worth putting in the deck.\r\n\r\n_Good cards that weren't included:_\r\n\r\n[Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) is super solid on Rogue and (in my opinion) is worth including for most playstyles. It also really makes Dauntless better.\r\n\r\nResource/card draw from [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091) and [Helicarrier](/card/29026) are good consistent cards and almost definitely worth it in multiplayer. \r\n\r\n[Beauty and the Thief](/card/38020) isn't the most high-priority card, but it's very efficient and worth including (100% include if you're playing multiplayer with Gambit!).\r\n\r\nI'm sure I missed plenty of great cards too.

She must get them from the corresponding type of card on [Touched](/card/38002) or through other means\r\n- The traits gained from the card stay on Rogue, even if [Touched](/card/38002) moves, the character leaves play, or Rogue flips to alter-ego\r\n  - Note that she will lose **aerial** if she moves [Touched](/card/38002) off an ally, UNLESS that ally itself had **aerial** in which case she will gain that trait for the round\r\n- [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) can only pull events of the same designation as the card that [Touched](/card/38002) is attached to\r\n  - If [Touched](/card/38002) is attached to a basic ally, then you can get a basic event from the owner's discard pile; if attached to an aspect ally, then you can get an aspect event of matching color from the owner's discard pile; if attached to a signature ally, hero, or alter-ego, you can get a signature event from the owner's discard pile (she will not gain stalwart from touching an alter-ego)\r\n  - Rogue can [Make the Call](/card/01071) allies from multiplayer discards, touch them, and use [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) to dig through the ally's owner's discard instead of her own\r\n  - [Longshot](/card/39071) from Mojomania is owned by the scenario, and cannot be used with [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)\r\n- \"Put into play\" is a unique mechanic from \"playing\" a card that **ignores that card's play restrictions**. Just like how \"put into play\" does not trigger the when revealed effects on encounter cards, [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) and [Make the Call](/card/01071) allow for playing [Ghost-Spider](/card/27048) and [Gamora](/card/19020), even when their play restrictions are not met\r\n- If [Misled](/card/38027) is coming up in the deck from Rogue's nemesis set, milling it off the deck with one of the many mill effects here will send it to the encounter discard without it ever triggering!\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## ***Hands, Touching Hands***\r\n\r\n- **[Kaluu](/card/21014)** grants access to **[Summoning Spell](/card/21055)** recursion better than most mystics! With essentially 4 copies of [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) thanks to **[Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)**, Rogue can easily get around the play restrictions on [Gamora](/card/19020) and [Ghost-Spider](/card/27048), while also gaining economy and tempo when hitting [Beast](/card/33011) or [Professor X](/card/32019)\r\n  - A key feature of the combo is that [Kaluu](/card/21014) into [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) is playable off a 5-card hand, and [Kaluu](/card/21014) can even grab [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) or [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) to get the combo started\r\n  - Once [Kaluu](/card/21014) is out, he should basically stay out the entire game. Never chump with him, except if he's replayable; if he accidentally gets back in the shuffle, use [Call for Aid](/card/12015) to get him again. As long as [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) is in the discard, every copy of [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) becomes a copy of [Summoning Spell](/card/21055), but Rogue needs to touch [Kaluu](/card/21014) to play it\r\n  - This falters when having a specific trait card in hand, because of the rigid nature of [Touched](/card/38002). Rogue needs to touch [Kaluu](/card/21014) to play [Summoning Spell](/card/21055), which turns off the ability to play the trait card of the ally that [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) pulls, because [Touched](/card/38002) can't be moved to the new ally in an efficient way\r\n   - For this reason, we have redundancy in the form of [Make the Call](/card/01071)!\r\n- Early game [Call for Aid](/card/12015) or [Weapon X](/card/35022) dump allies into the discard! Follow up with **[Make the Call](/card/01071)** for the ally that matches whatever traited economy piece is in hand!\r\n  - For example, if [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026) is in hand, a [Make the Call](/card/01071) for [Kaluu](/card/21014) can play the in-hand [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026) from a 5-card hero hand\r\n  - Once economy pieces start coming into play, more expensive plays like [Kaluu](/card/21014)->[Quincarrier](/card/08023) become options, and things start to snowball from there\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## ***Reaching Out***\r\n\r\nThere are a couple \"pockets\" of cards to reach into:\r\n\r\n- **[Kaluu](/card/21014)**\r\n  - Multi-trait allies are valuable to any trait-based strategy, and [Kaluu](/card/21014) is no exception with both **Mystic** and **Avenger**, granting us access to **[The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026)**, **[Quincarrier](/card/08023)**, and importantly **[Summoning Spell](/card/21055)**\r\n  - Touching [Kaluu](/card/21014) turns [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) into [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) or [Make the Call](/card/01071)\r\n  - **[Call for Aid](/card/12015)** is here to get [Kaluu](/card/21014) early, hopefully dumping [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) in the process. The best opening is [Call for Aid](/card/12015)->[Kaluu](/card/21014)->[Summoning Spell](/card/21055) to set up two allies with useful traits\r\n- **[Gamora](/card/19020)**\r\n  - Digs for Rogue's powerful events like [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008), [Energy Transfer](/card/38007), and [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)\r\n  - Playable off of [Make the Call](/card/01071) or [Summoning Spell](/card/21055)\r\n  - Good source of mill\r\n- **[Ghost-Spider](/card/27048)**\r\n  - Grants access to **Web-Warrior** trait for extra resources and card plays in conjunction with [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023) and her **interrupt**\r\n - Every time she leaves play is another [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)->[Summoning Spell](/card/21055) play with [Kaluu](/card/21014) out; occasionally the timing works out for her to grab [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008), especially in multiplayer\r\n - A prime target for [Make the Call](/card/01071), or her own cheaper signature version with [Across the Spider-Verse](/card/27018), but can also be played normally once **[Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023)** is in play (paying full cost, or touching [Ghost-Spider](/card/27048) to play it for free)\r\n  - Touching [Ghost-Spider](/card/27048) turns [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) into **[Across the Spider-Verse](/card/27018)**, which is particularly useful when about to activate her for her last hp\r\n- **[Beast](/card/33011)**\r\n  - Pulls double-duty on being able to get resources and board control simultaneously, while giving access to the **Genius** trait for **[Ingenuity](/card/29027)**\r\n  - Playing [Ingenuity](/card/29027) from hero form is unique to Rogue\r\n- **[Gambit](/card/38003)**\r\n  - Only way to recur her hero cards with [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)\r\n  - Great vs tough, multiple enemies, or villain stages since his interrupt goes off before the attack resolves\r\n  - Can grant the **X-Men** trait in alter-ego for [The X-Jet](/card/32020)\r\n  - Is NOT able to recur [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008) efficiently, unless [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) is available to move [Touched](/card/38002) to the villain (if [Touched](/card/38002) is on [Gambit](/card/38003), [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008) is unplayable)\r\n  - Unfortunately, cannot be [Touched](/card/38002) to get back [Beauty and the Thief](/card/37019) because he is not a basic ally\r\n- **[Professor X](/card/32019)**\r\n  - Here for stability and is a good [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) target\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://imgur.com/xPSO7uS.jpeg\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## ***Touching Me...TOUCHING YOOOOOUUUUUU***\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Rogue's signature events split her kit focus by rewarding touching the villain every turn as **retaliate** is always the best keyword for them. Stun, confuse, and tough are all worth much more than \"draw 1 card\" or \"deal 2 extra points of value\". The drawn card is often dead in many cases!\r\n\r\n- **[Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008)** is the real culprit that splits Rogue's kit. Easily her most effortlessly strong card, stopping 2 attacks any time it's played, and in multiplayer defending for multiple players since it can draw an attack away from another player. As a bonus, you'll get two pings of retaliate in most cases. The problem is: you never know when you will draw it! So often the best play just becomes: put [Touched](/card/38002) on the villain, status it with one event, and hope to draw into [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008), rinse and repeat. It's a pretty boring loop and can't even be manipulated with [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) since pulling it off [Gambit](/card/38003) leaves it unplayable, as [Touched](/card/38002) isn't on the villain!\r\n- On the other hand, **[Energy Transfer](/card/38007)** is her most flexible card. Being able to move [Touched](/card/38002) lets her do both trait-oriented and signature-oriented plays in the same turn! Granted, she will need economy setup to support this, hence the object of the deck. Readying Rogue for 2/2 is very flexible, more so once [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) is out to make her 3 ATK (you'll likely not be damaging a friendly character other than Spider-Ham, so her 3-THW is inaccessible with [Energy Transfer](/card/38007)). The heal is much appreciated since she'll be taking attacks, and the free 2 damage really turns this into: \"heal 2, deal 2, thwart 2\", which is great value!\r\n- **[Goin' Rogue](/card/38005)** is her next best event, able to target any scheme while still confusing the villain. Confuse helps her flip to alter-ego, granting her an additional card and a use of [Weapon X](/card/35022), which is very key to her early game economy. [Deft Focus](/card/16024) and [X-Gene](/card/38019) are primarily here for these three events.\r\n- **[Southern Cross](/card/38006)** is pretty limited unfortunately. It does very little to help maintain board state, as dealing 6-8 villain damage is very low priority. Needing to target the same enemy with its damage and stun effects makes this lesser than [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005) and a worse [Web-Shot](/card/27034). Often times this amounts to 4ER for a stun, which Rogue just can't afford until the late game\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n## ***One, Touching One***\r\n\r\nWe need some serious +1s, because Rogue has an economy problem, see caveats section down below. From experience, Rogue needs about two additional economy cards to start feeling like a normal hero, as a kit full of 2+ cost cards leads to turns of \"play one card, make a basic action, and pass\". It becomes very difficult to play trait-strategies when she can't line up allies *and also* play the trait-matching cards in the same turn\r\n\r\nThe goal here is to line up enough +1s to be able to start affording more card plays. Redundancies are in place to maximize the chances of propping up her economy, even if some of these are milled. Knowing what ally+economy trait combos are still left in the deck (or playable from discard) is very important to piloting this deck well or deciding when to [Summoning Spell](/card/21055). All of these have pros and cons, but with enough overlap she can get her engine going!\r\n\r\n- **[The X-Jet](/card/32020)** is expensive, but playable right away with the bonus of being useful in the villain phase for [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008), but the downside of being dead while in alter-ego\r\n- **[Helicarrier](/card/01092)** is useful in both forms, but doesn't help with [Make the Call](/card/01071) or [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008)\r\n- **[Clarity of Purpose](/card/31029)** is cheap and unrestricted, but costs health and isn't usable in alter-ego. [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) can help heal off the accumulated damage\r\n- **[Deft Focus](/card/16024)** works on 8 of Rogue's events, but not being usable on [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008) is a drawback\r\n- **[X-Gene](/card/38019)** is useful to pay for [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008) in the villain phase, but being restricted to signature events and only being playable in alter-ego are HUGE drawbacks, so this should never be the primary economy option\r\n- **[The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026)** grants card draw rather than resources, which is generally superior and can help keep Rogue in hero form. Its low-cost and ease of access with all the ways this deck recurs [Kaluu](/card/21014) makes it shine\r\n- **[Quincarrier](/card/08023)** is easily the least restricted economy option, working on every card in the deck and being pretty easy to set up with continuous [Kaluu](/card/21014) access, but affording a 3-cost card from hero form can hold it back\r\n- **[Ingenuity](/card/29027)** is another great unrestricted economy option that is cheaper than [Quincarrier](/card/08023) and also works with [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008). A 6 resource turn with both this and [Beast](/card/33011) (or Make the Call into Beast), can result in an instant [Ingenuity](/card/29027) off the double resource that [Beast](/card/33011) pulls, making this a go-to option. [Beast](/card/33011)'s up-front cost makes this harder to set up than [Kaluu](/card/21014) in most other situations. \r\n- **[Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023)** is another source of card draw, the best exhaust target for [Across the Spider-Verse](/card/27018), and grants access to playing [Ghost-Spider](/card/27048) normally (rather than \"putting her into play\"). It can be played for free once [Ghost-Spider](/card/27048) is out, but is limited to only granting resources on turns where she leaves play\r\n- **[Weapon X](/card/35022)** is a key source of mill, but also gets [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004), [Gambit](/card/38003), and [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) very reliably, the former are playable in alter-ego and the latter when flipping up. The damage can be healed off with [Energy Transfer](/card/38007). The main drawback is being only playable from alter-ego\r\n\r\n*Note that in multiplayer, Rogue can touch a mutant alter-ego to be able to play [X-Gene](/card/38019) and [Weapon X](/card/35022) from hero form, making them much easier to get down*\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## ***Good Times Never Seemed So Good***\r\n\r\n- **[Team Training](/card/04016)** extends the \"good times\" with our allies. **An extra hp is an extra turn where Rogue can draw into the matching trait card**. For example, after playing [Beast](/card/33011), Rogue now gets 3 turns instead of 2 to draw into [Ingenuity](/card/29027), a 50% odds increase!\r\n  - [Gamora](/card/19020) draws one more time\r\n  - [Gambit](/card/38003) swings one more time, and stays alive as her [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) battery\r\n  - Importantly, an extra health can keep [Kaluu](/card/21014) out of the deck shuffle\r\n- Rogue is going to be eating a lot of attacks, since chumping her allies means not using them for their traits. Extra ally hp means she can sometimes basic defend and still not have to worry about threat or damage thanks to allies taking care of it\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://imgur.com/mrxWbHG.jpeg\">\r\n\r\n*Pour Some Sugah on our Multiplayer Partners!*\r\n\r\n## **Multiplayer**\r\n\r\nRogue excels most in multiplayer with multiple discard piles to tutor from. Unfortunately, most of the time her own events are better to grab than anything else, and being able to grab an event at a time that 1) it is playable and 2) she can afford it is very difficult to accomplish. Stalwart on command is also not beating out the status utility of putting [Touched](/card/38002) on the villain. If built with a specific partner in mind though, she can really shine! A Protection partner can pass her a [Dauntless](/card/16016) for instance!\r\n\r\nI've put together a [handy spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWTL-SQEuFAd4Gzuc1RtInaA48yhFxOw9USRwDTou3M/edit#gid=0) analyzing multiplayer partners for Rogue, primarily looking at:\r\n\r\n1) What **traits** does the hero bring?\r\n\r\n2) Does the hero have **aerial** access so she can get aerial+stalwart at the same time?\r\n\r\n3) Noteworthy events in **bold**\r\n\r\n4) Does the hero have a signature ally, and what traits does that ally provide?\r\n\r\n5) Does the hero have **superpowers** in kit that Rogue can play with her own copy of [Deft Focus](/card/16024) (after taking them with [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009))?\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis, and having run a few of the combinations I've come up with some ideal and not ideal pairings:\r\n\r\nTop Characters Rogue Likes:\r\n\r\n- **Spider-Woman**\r\n  - Rogue gains access to events and traited allies from 2 aspects!\r\n  - Plenty of superpowers!\r\n  - Can ready SpW out of turn by stealing [Self-Propelled Glide](/card/04039), even giving Rogue aerial!\r\n  - [Pheromones](/card/04036) is a pretty darn good event to steal!\r\n\r\n- **Adam Warlock**\r\n  - Access to events and allies from all aspects!\r\n  - Good superpower cards that even mill her deck!\r\n  - Access to mystic events of all colors, that also mill her deck!\r\n  - [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)->[Quantum Magic](/card/21040)->anything from her discard!\r\n\r\n- **Storm**\r\n  - Storm with her cape out and [Hurricane](/card/36003) in play means Rogue will simultaneously have retaliate, stalwart, and aerial for her events!\r\n  - Stealing Storm's events can even trigger the **special** on her weather cards!\r\n\r\n- **Star-Lord**\r\n  - Ability to gain the **guardian** trait in addition to the trait on all of the allies he runs, basically turning any ally into a useful dual-trait ally!\r\n  - Gaining the guardian trait is great for [Blaze of Glory](/card/17015)!\r\n\r\n- **Scarlet Witch**\r\n  - Despite competing for [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026), having 3 uses of [Chaos Magic](/card/15003) every deck cycle really helps Rogue's economy!\r\n  - [Warp Reality](/card/15006) is one of the best cancels in the game!\r\n  - Extra [Hex Bolt](/card/15004)s are never bad! Bonus for being **superpower**!\r\n\r\n- **Honorable Mentions**\r\n  - **Vision** (through his signature ally) and **Miles** give her access to strong dual-traits! Rogue can even trigger the **specials** on Miles' identity with his events!\r\n  - **Gamora** gives her access to events from multiple aspects!\r\n  - **Venom** grants her strong events and [Locked and Loaded](/card/20004) that can tutor weapons in a weapon-based Rogue deck!\r\n  - **Doctor Strange** is generically strong with good traits and [Master of the Mystic Arts](/card/09005) to trigger his **Invocations**!\r\n  - Rogue can steal [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) to set up [Get Over Here!](/card/06014) here for a **Thor** partner!\r\n  - Perhaps my personal fave: Rogue can use [Parental Guidance](/card/27003) to put [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008) underneath [George Stacy](/card/27007) for **Ghost-Spider**!\r\n\r\nTop Characters that Like Rogue:\r\n\r\n- **Groot**\r\n  - Rogue can place growth counters on Groot!\r\n  - Rogue can then steal max strength Groot events!\r\n\r\n- **Nova**\r\n  - Rogue can play [Unleash Nova Force](/card/28006) for Nova!\r\n  - Rogue recurs [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) for the both of them!\r\n\r\n- **Cyclops**\r\n  - [Touched](/card/38002) on the villain means Cyclops' *Optic Blast* is always active!\r\n  - Rogue gets access to his Psionic traited ally and can also use his [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010) to grab tactics from her discard!\r\n\r\n- **Spider-Ham**\r\n  - Gains counters when Rogue touches him with [Energy Transfer](/card/38007)!\r\n  - Ham has great events to steal after [Energy Transfer](/card/38007)!\r\n\r\n- **Ironheart**\r\n  - Rogue can place progress counters on Ironheart!\r\n  - Rogue can recur [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) for the both of them!\r\n \r\nWorst Rogue Pairings\r\n\r\n- **[Hawkeye](/card/04001a)**, **[Nebula](/card/22001a)**, **[Ant-Man](/card/12001a)**, and **[War Machine](/card/23001a)** basically have no usable events for [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009), no superpower cards, no access to multiple traits\r\n- **[Gambit](/card/37001a)** takes away her ability to play her own [Gambit](/card/38003) ally, which means Rogue can no longer [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) her own cards\r\n  - [Gambit](/card/37001a) also loses access to his own [Rogue](/card/37002) ally, who is also very strong\r\n  - [Gambit](/card/37001a)'s events aren't great to steal and he brings no new traits to the table. Really quite a disappoint that they don't work well together!\r\n\r\n*What are your thoughts on the best and worst Rogue partners?*\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## **Other Cards and What Not to Include**\r\n\r\nVarious \"40th cards\" have cycled in and out over the months\r\n\r\n- **[Team-Building Exercise](/card/12024)** is actually quite bad, as most trait-specific upgrades and supports don't actually have the related trait themselves. Already needing the trait in order to activate TBE, doesn't help very much and sacrifices the opportunity to put [Touched](/card/38002) on the villain\r\n- **[Rapid Response](/card/08031)** can help keep [Kaluu](/card/21014) or a traited ally in play\r\n- **The Power Ofs** help offset her economy\r\n- **[Adam Warlock](/card/17011)** is another **Mystic** traited ally with a neat ability, but [Kaluu](/card/21014)'s dual-traits, lower cost, easy access, and survivability lead to him being cut\r\n- **[Maria Hill](/card/01067)** is a fine 40th, but isn't the best hit off [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) due to lack of good traits\r\n- **[Black Panther](/card/23012)** is completely unnecessary thanks to [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)\r\n- **[Spiritual Meditation](/card/15019)** should always be a consideration for a Mystic deck, but no basic **mystic** allies means that it can't be pulled from [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)\r\n- **[Moon Girl](/card/28018)** is theoretically great if Rogue can ever get [Ingenuity](/card/29027), [Quincarrier](/card/08023), and [The X-Jet](/card/32020) in play at the same time, but requiring [Beast](/card/33011) to already be in play sinks her\r\n- **[Honorary Guardian](/card/22035)** helps to play [Gamora](/card/19020) naturally and the extra health is appreciated when face tanking to save the allies, but needing [Gamora](/card/19020) to already be in play was too difficult and the opportunity cost of putting [Touched](/card/38002) on the villain or another ally was high\r\n- **[Beauty and the Thief](/card/37019)** is hard to recur since it relies on having both [Gambit](/card/38003) *and* a basic ally out\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n## ***Rogue Caveats***\r\n***Skip straight to the comments if you want, the remainder is existential Rogue design analysis***\r\n\r\nI was so excited upon the Rogue reveal that she became the first hero I played on the *same day as reveal*. I was ready for Spider-Woman's reign at the top of my list to be seriously challenged by another hero with creative and free flowing deckbuilding. But Rogue has some serious shortcomings that will become more apparent once she becomes more widely available. Here are some takeaways of three months of testing with her:\r\n\r\n- Rogue has the worst economy in the game (aside from arguably Hulk). Her kit is 31 total resource cost, or about 2 resources per card (I'm estimating [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) at being 2-cost most of the time), without any resource cards, abilities, or upgrades\r\n - For comparison, Hulk's kit costs a total of 30 and he has both a resource support and triple resources, though lacking in hand size. Still, not a great comparison for Rogue to have\r\n- Not being able to move [Touched](/card/38002) except with *Skin Contact* or [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) is incredibly limiting. To make matters worse, Rogue's kit has more benefits for **not** touching friendly characters, splitting her focus. Rogue is often at odd with her own aspect cards, compared to a hero like Spider-Woman, who is incentivized to play her aspect cards\r\n\r\nThese two major shortcomings leave her *actual play* to leave something to be desired compared to her theory crafting. A severely restricted economy and split kit make running *any* trait-focused builds difficult \r\n\r\n- For instance, a deck focusing on a **single additional trait** is usually inferior to running a hero that has that trait already, and makes multiplayer a fight over who gets to play the unique cards of that trait.\r\n\r\n- On the other hand, a deck filled with **multiple traits** has difficulty lining up those traits with any consistency, drawing dead hands. \r\n\r\nI ran into limitation after limitation after 50-something test plays across various decks, aspects, and traits; usually resulting in frustration and disappointment. The most success I've had with Rogue is to play her *completely ignoring the only unique thing she brings to the table*; statusing the villain like a discount [Miles Morales](/card/27030b) and ready-stacking with 3-stats from [Jacket](/card/38004), using [Utopia](/card/33020) and [Ever Vigilant](/card/17030); while [Dauntless](/card/16016) gives her retaliate and [Med Team](/card/01080) [Gambit](/card/38003) gives her reliable event recursion in the same vein as [Team Training](/card/04016) [Kaluu](/card/21014) in this deck. \r\n\r\nBut not leveraging her trait ability in any way is *not interesting to me*. For me to be satisfied I need:\r\n\r\n- A build that utilizes more than one trait (so as not to be inferior to a hero that naturally has that trait), but in a manner that is unique and successful to her\r\n\r\n**I'm presenting this deck as what I consider the best way to leverage her uniqueness for all you fellow Johnny players out there!

As charge counters *don't* leave when you flip to Alter-Ego, we don't have to (or want to) spend them every turn. Ideally, you want to sit on 3-4 counters. This makes [Rogue](/card/37002) free or next to free whenever she hits your hand (unless you've got someone playing Rogue), as well as ensuring that every time you draw [Royal Flush](/card/37007) and [Natural Agility](/card/37008) you can play them for their maximum effect. [Charged Card](/card/37006) is good, but is only worth overcharging if you either:\r\n- Have more than 4 counters already to burn\r\n- Need damage to get rid of something *right now* (such as a nemesis minion or the villain's current stage\r\n- Need one of the keywords, for example avoiding retaliate, tough, or you're about to massively overkill a weak minion\r\n\r\n### Mutant Education\r\n[Mutant Education](/card/37021) is secretly amazing, making the [X-Mansion](/card/37018) possibly one of the only pieces in the deck to mulligan for. Once the Mansion is in play, Mutant Education will replace itself, making your deck effectively 3 cards smaller (and justifying my bad habit of having 2 copies of cards instead of 3), increasing your odds of getting what you need. More importantly, however, it can allow you to stack your deck to ensure his most powerful cards like [Royal Flush](/card/37007), [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010), and [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) come back over and over again.\r\n\r\nJust one quick note: [Mockingbird](/card/01083)is only here because she prevents what few attacks the villain gets to make on you in hero form. [Colossus](/card/35021) would be a much better fit, but he's currently occupied by the Rogue deck we're also playing!\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more to be said about playing this deck, but it should become fairly obvious as you give it a shot.

Thank you!**\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Dealing Damage**\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nLooking for damage? I got you~\r\n- [Warrior Skill](/card/35016) and [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047) boost all your attacks! Combine them with Charge counters!\r\n - [Royal Flush](/card/37007) can deal up to 15 damage!\r\n - [One by One](/card/28014) can deal up to 14 damage and is easier to trigger!\r\n- Use [Mutant Education](/card/37021) to recur [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010) and [Royal Flush](/card/37007) for crazy resources + damage!\r\n\r\n[Royal Flush](/card/37007) is your flashiest move with the most damage. Use it cleave through minions and blast the villain down to size. This is one of your highest priorities when it comes to [Warrior Skill](/card/35016) and/or [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047) and you always want to try and maximize its damage where possible.\r\n\r\n[Charged Card](/card/37006) is a good damage card. If your others aren't in hand? Use it with [X-Gene](/card/38019) to bring its cost down. The piercing and ranged can both be useful when facing Tough and Retaliate especially, but don't hesitate to throw it without a single Charge counter boosting it.\r\n\r\nWith [One by One](/card/28014), it's double or nothing. If there are no minions, you likely have better things to do and should not play it. If there are minions? It's normally most efficient to spend the exact amount of Charge counters/uses of [Warrior Skill](/card/35016) to defeat the minion, without excess damage.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Threat Removal**\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nSick of struggling with threat in Aggression? Check it out~\r\n- Put [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) on yourself, then use [Utopia](/card/33020) to ready yourself up in alter-ego - you can use your alter-ego thwaring action twice!\r\n- Use [X-Mansion](/card/32049) to heal 2 THW allies [Psylocke](/card/35013) or [Rogue](/card/37002) for repeated use!\r\n- Choose [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) when you use [Mutant Education](/card/37021) to have a constant supply of threat removal!\r\n\r\n[Creole Charmer](/card/37009) is excellent, and you can use allies to get schemes in range of it. Gambit's alter-ego thwarting action can also help to set it up.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Gambit's alter-ego thwarting action? If there's threat to remove, there's threat to remove - but it also lets you scout out your boost card or, if your deck is about to run out, your extra encounter card. Sometimes, if a scheme only has 1 threat on it, you can discard a 0 boost icon card and use [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) to draw card.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Survivability**\r\n<hr>\r\nYour defense? That's covered too!~\r\n- You have 3 DEF and 2 defense cards - [Natural Agility](/card/37008) gives you a charge counter too!\r\n- Between your allies + [Creole Charmer](/card/37009), you have 14 blocks for villain activations per deck pass!\r\n - _Note: you won't be able to block 14 per deck pass. The point is the crazy availability!_\r\n- You can heal yourself with [X-Mansion](/card/32049)! This is particularly good when healing allies would cause problems with the ally limit.\r\n\r\nIt's usually best to block with allies, but with 3 DEF and [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005)? Gambit can do it, especially when [Natural Agility](/card/37008) is in hand!\r\n\r\nYou can even ignore a minion once your [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005) is out, defending against it and readying as if nothing had happened while using allies to block the villain. This can be a good way to close out games; why deal with a big 6+ hp minion when you can hit the villain a couple of fully-charged [Royal Flush](/card/37007)es and win!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Basics - The House Always Wins **\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[X-Mansion](/card/32049), [X-Gene](/card/38019), [The X-Jet](/card/32020), and [Utopia](/card/33020) are your top priorities when you mulligan. [Forge](/card/36022) is great too, especially with a double resource card, as he can grab your other X-Men supports!\r\n\r\nWe want to turn on our [Mutant Education](/card/37021) engine with [X-Mansion](/card/32049) - it's just a house, but it does a lot for us! We also want to get some reliable resource generation beyond recurring [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010) with [Mutant Education](/card/37021), and readying is always great.\r\n\r\nWhile it's not a priority, don't forget to sneak an [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) on yourself so [Utopia](/card/33020) can ready you in either form!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Play Your Cards Right**\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThe nuance in Gambit and this deck comes from how you flip between hero and alter-ego forms and how you manage your counters.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to flipping to alter-ego, try to ensure the villain is confused or make sure you're willing to deal with the consequences of the main scheme potentially being completed. With 5 confuses in the deck, and ways to recur them with [Mutant Education](/card/37021), you should ideally be changing form on roughly 4 out of 5 turns! Flip, flip, flip - _with confuses up on the villain._\r\n\r\n(_Note: This is less effective against steady/stalwart villains. You can swap Psylocke for [Magik](/card/32042) or [Wolverine](/card/32041)_.\r\n\r\nWhile it can be tempting to stay alter-ego sometimes, every turn spent in alter-ego is one less Charge counter gained from your hero ability. Keep flipping!\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to counters, try to build a small reserve of Charge counters to power up [Natural Agility](/card/37008) and stay ready for any nasty minions. Spend smart~ Use what you need to deal with the problem in front of you and get efficient damage on the villain.\r\n\r\nThere is no point saving up 10 counters and losing before you spend them - but flying at 0 counters is bad news and leaves you at the mercy of Lady Luck!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Get Educated!**\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[Mutant Education](/card/37021) is an amazing card once [X-Mansion](/card/32049) is in play. Before that, it's low priority and should only be used if you can't spend your whole hand efficiently. Use it with [X-Mansion](/card/32049) in play to fill your deck with your best cards and replace itself!\r\n\r\n[Mutant Education](/card/37021)'s best targets are [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010), [Rogue](/card/37002), [Royal Flush](/card/37007), and [Creole Charmer](/card/37009).\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb, I recommend shuffling 1x [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010) back in at all times if there is one in your discard pile, and then one event appropriate to the situation.\r\n\r\nIs the threat fine? Perhaps you have Psylocke on the board? Don't worry about [Creole Charmer](/card/37009). But if you need to remove threat or heal? Put it back in the deck!\r\n\r\nSitting on a big stack of Charge counters? Grab yourself a [Royal Flush](/card/37007)! Forced to use them all? Maybe go for more counter generation.\r\n\r\nAnd [Rogue](/card/37002), while lacking special synergy with the deck or our gameplan, is just _very, very good_. With 4+ counters, she is reduced to 0-cost! 0-cost?! Yes, a 0-cost ally who can remove 4 threat and block twice. That's just silly value.\r\n\r\nWith [Mutant Education](/card/37021), Gambit always has a trick up his sleeve.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n**Charge de card, throw de card, and have fun!** _(Thanks to the users of the MC Community server for the feedback that helped shape the deck!)_\r\n<hr>", "user_id": 16053, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "28014": 3, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32047": 2, "32048": 1, "32049": 1, "33019": 1, "33020": 1, "33035": 2, "35013": 1, "35014": 1, "35016": 2, "36022": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37021": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26330, "name": "Gambit -  Flippin' awesome", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T17:02:34+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-25T02:34:26+00:00", "description_md": "This deck revolves around flipping between hero and alter-ego every turn.

All the other allies are pretty self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n**Events:** Not much to say here, once you\u2019re set up you\u2019ll be drawing these pretty consistently and nothing feels better than back to back [Royal Flush](https://marvelcdb.com/card/37010)es for 18.

Being able to access the extra draw as Remy, while keeping your ability to thwart makes for a powerful mitigation combo.\r\n\r\n**Wrap-up:** Gambit lives his life in a moral grey area and now you can too!

It will pay off when you look at your board and you have all your resource generators, multiple allies and [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026) down.\r\n\r\n- Rogue is quite good at **status-locking the villain**, so don't feel pressured to do [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) if stunning or confusing them will do the job just fine.\r\n\r\n- [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026) is great here and is another payoff for [The Power in All of Us](/card/13024). If you haven't seen either of your 2 mystics yet, it's worth keeping it in hand for the next turn. Yes, it feels bad waiting around with a dead card in hand, but **the payoff is crazy**, so be patient and watch out for the timing. [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012) and [Clea](/card/09013) are here to enable this trick, but both are useful by themselves. One helps us find [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) and the other is a recurring chumpblocker.\r\n\r\n- [Ever Vigilant](/card/17030) is an auto-include since you'll always have aerial. It's stupidly efficient, especially once you have [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) out.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**I managed to beat (all on Expert):** Thanos, Kang, Mutagen Formula, Venom, Klaw and Loki. I've been playtesting it for weeks on TTS and found that the deck does best against villains that just want to beat you up. Protection still struggles with threat, unfortunately, so **be careful** with that. Expert Venom Goblin for instance didn't beat me up but he drowned me in threat.\r\n\r\n<br><center>\r\n\r\n![img1](https://imgur.com/hLe7xnB.png)\r\n\r\n</center>", "user_id": 15361, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "01092": 1, "09012": 1, "09013": 1, "09026": 1, "13018": 1, "13024": 2, "16024": 1, "17030": 3, "28018": 1, "29023": 1, "29024": 1, "29025": 1, "29035": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26340, "name": "Go for Champions: Blue Edition\u2122 | Leadership Rogue", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T19:30:05+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-02T04:08:05+00:00", "description_md": "<br>\r\n\r\nBlue version of another list I built. The goal of this deck is to attach [Touched](/card/38002) to a Champion ally and loop [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025), one of the most broken cards in the game. Needless to say, this list works better in Multiplayer or 2-handed, but I did great with it in true Solo too. Plays quite similar to my other list tbh, so notes are pretty much the same.\r\n\r\n<br><center>\r\n\r\n![img1](https://imgur.com/eW7kKiE.png)\r\n\r\n</center><br>\r\n\r\n- You loop [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) by **attaching Touched to one of your basic allies and then playing [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)**. You'll also naturally thin your deck once you have enough allies and supports/upgrades out, so **[Pinpoint](/card/29035) will help you consistently redraw it too**.\r\n\r\n- This might look Resource-heavy, but that's only because the **deck itself is quite Resource-hungry**. Once you're fully setup your [The Power in All of Us](/card/13024) will mostly be used for replaying Basic allies, so it holds up well in the late-game. A single copy of [Band Together](/card/21018) since we don't have 1-drop allies like [Stinger] here and don't want it to clog up our hands. You could probably even cut it for a third copy of [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) or a Helicarrier, honestly.\r\n\r\n- **Mulligan aggressively for setup pieces**. Your priority should be establishing sources of card/resource advantage like [The X-Jet](/card/32020) or [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091). [The Power in All of Us](/card/13024) will help you pay for these early. Card draw is especially powerful as it allows you to **find your combo pieces faster**. We're running both [Deft Focus](/card/16024) and [X-Gene](/card/38019), so you should be able to ramp and still do other things.\r\n\r\n- Obviously you need to survive to do all the good stuff this deck wants to do, so **don't worry about chumping** with your Champions during your first deck pass. Alternatively, you could include some copies of [Regroup](/card/19032) or [Rapid Response](/card/08031) to give your allies more longevity.\r\n\r\n- With that said, [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) actually synergizes well with your gameplan. When you're trying to keep your allies alive for the Champion trait, it only makes sense to use them for something else. Worst case scenario it draws you into your combo faster.\r\n\r\n- [Falcon](/card/29015) and [Patriot](/card/29016) are expensive, yes, but actually great because Rogue's statline is so solid, especially if you have [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) out.\r\n\r\n- Don't rush into the [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) loop in the early game. If you have the opportunity to establish your board instead, **now is the time to do that**. It's an expensive event, so your turns will be more efficient in the mid-to-late game if you have enough resources to play [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) and still do something else. It will pay off when you look at your board and you have all your resource generators, multiple allies and [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026) down.\r\n\r\n- Rogue is quite good at **status-locking the villain**, so don't feel pressured to do [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) if stunning or confusing them will do the job just fine.\r\n\r\n- [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026) is great here and is another payoff for [The Power in All of Us](/card/13024). If you haven't seen either of your 2 mystics yet, it's worth keeping it in hand for the next turn. Yes, it feels bad waiting around with a dead card in hand, but **the payoff is crazy**, so be patient and watch out for the timing. [Adam Warlock](/card/17011) and [Kaluu](/card/21014) are here to enable this trick, but both are useful by themselves. One can make use of the extra cards you'll draw from [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) and the other can help you find [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025).\r\n\r\n<br><center>\r\n\r\n![img2](https://media2.giphy.com/media/My13yyUCagTMO0Fhv4/giphy.gif?cid=790b761179a20364cd30e80a98516814dd78ad7743661a63&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)\r\n\r\n<br></center>", "user_id": 15361, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01073": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "03017": 2, "09026": 1, "13018": 1, "13019": 1, "13024": 2, "16024": 1, "17011": 1, "21014": 1, "21018": 1, "28018": 1, "29015": 1, "29016": 1, "29023": 1, "29024": 1, "29025": 1, "32020": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26341, "name": "Stun-Locking Celestial Boots | Drop Kick Rogue", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T19:30:58+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-25T10:43:47+00:00", "description_md": "<br>\r\n\r\n_Y'all remember when Rogue absorbed the power of every X-Men and Avenger and held back a Celestial by the foot?

We have plenty of **resource generators **here, so try putting some of those down. [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) and [The X-Jet](/card/36023) are priorities because they feed [Drop Kick](/card/10014).\r\n\r\n- **Plan your turns well.** [Touched](/card/38002) needs to be attached to the villain so that [Southern Cross](/card/38006) can stun, while [Dive Bomb](/card/17028) needs it attached to an ally. **Proper sequencing** should fix any conflicts.\r\n\r\n- You should be able to get full value from [Drop Kick](/card/10014) everytime you play it, but it's not the end of the world if you don't. There's other ways to stun in the deck, so don't miss out on what could be more efficient ways to spend your resources.\r\n\r\n- [Dive Bomb](/card/17028) is a blast with Rogue, so we want all the allies we can get so that aerial is turned on. Best way to do that? **Cheap, 2-drop allies**. \r\n\r\n- No, I'm not running [Hulk](/card/01050). In my personal experience he rarely pays off. It's just too risky and it's not like you struggle for damage. You do you though. Honestly, **all the allies are replaceable**.\r\n\r\n- There's a case to be made that [Marvel Boy](/card/21041) is a bad card by today's standards, but seeing as how Mutant Genesis is filled with Tough tokens,** piercing is incredibly valuable**. Yes, 0 THW sucks, but Rogue's Hero Kit is excellent at dealing with threat. He's also a printed Physical resource.\r\n\r\n- [Mockingbird](/card/01083) is another lowkey outdated card, but we'll take any stun effects we can get. Her being a physical resource also helps. \r\n\r\n- [Clobber](/card/18012) is an auto-include simply because of the physical resources, but it also comes in handy as a way to deal with pesky minions. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**Note:** whether or not you choose to count [Touched](/card/38002) towards the minimum deck size is up to you.\r\n\r\n<br><center>\r\n\r\n![img2](https://media4.giphy.com/media/tdK9iQCUAPBrA0mjHj/giphy.gif?cid=790b761146927a61845d50dc4e36b76bb9d5b25be0a5a44e&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)\r\n\r\n</center>", "user_id": 15361, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01055": 2, "01083": 1, "04040": 1, "10014": 3, "10018": 1, "16024": 1, "17028": 2, "18012": 3, "21041": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32041": 1, "35013": 1, "35014": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1, "38021": 1, "38022": 1, "38023": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26342, "name": "We spies now, Sugah | S.H.I.E.L.D. + One Way or Another", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T19:31:14+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-08T14:15:43+00:00", "description_md": "<br>\r\n\r\nThis is a typical good stuff S.H.I.E.L.D. list with some [One Way or Another](/card/22015) synergies. Rogue is one of my favourite heroes to play it with because **she can get the S.H.I.E.L.D. trait **herself. Plus, she' amazing at controlling threat, so why not benefit from pulling some side schemes?<center>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n![img1](https://imgur.com/zR8AqtV.png)\r\n\r\n<br></center>\r\n\r\n- If you piloted one of these spy decks before this should all be intuitive. One thing I'd say is **prioritize setting up** ASAP, as usual. [Government Liaison](/card/27054) is a great and cheap way to advance your gameplay early on.\r\n\r\n- How you use [One Way or Another](/card/22015) varies on your playstyle. Since [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005) and [Homeland Intervention](/card/27042) are great at removing large amounts of threat, **I prefer summoning the most problematic/bigger side schemes** right away instead of going for low threat ones. I like actively removing these from the encounter deck while I have control and information over the situation.  \r\n\r\n- [Chance Encounter](/card/26034) is an obvious payoff to [One Way or Another](/card/22015) and allows you to **repeatedly play** [Nick Fury](/card/01084), [Monica Chang](/card/27040) or [Professor X](/card/32019).\r\n\r\n- Not playing [Agent 13](/card/27046) or [Dum Dum Dugan](/card/27047). They're both great, but not including them also makes me feel better about not including [The Power in All of Us](/card/13024). I'd rather use [One Way or Another](/card/22015) to get resource advantage and **keep the curve low**.\r\n\r\n- I always thought [Counterintelligence](/card/08017) aged poorly but it actually still holds up well. We're not playing [Under Surveillance](/card/06031), so it helps to have a plan B just in case something goes wrong with the main scheme while we're messing around with side schemes. [Target Acquired](/card/08024) is a valid alternative though, since boost abilities are getting sillier.\r\n\r\n- [Monica Chang](/card/27040) + [Surveillance Team](/card/08016) is another combo I previously found kinda memey, but it's surprinsigly effective since you can exhaust the supports to Homeland Intervention.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**Note:** whether or not you choose to count Touched towards the minimum deck size is up to you.\r\n\r\n<br><center>\r\n\r\n![img2](https://media4.giphy.com/media/3WJwMhviLPHBiuPOWV/giphy.gif?cid=790b76110601d2fd5ba81dfd06d1c0fed2757aa7be9298df&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)\r\n\r\n</center>", "user_id": 15361, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01064": 2, "01083": 1, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01092": 1, "04047": 1, "08011": 1, "08012": 1, "08017": 1, "16024": 1, "22015": 2, "26034": 1, "27040": 1, "27042": 3, "27054": 2, "27055": 1, "32019": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26343, "name": "Bring me EVERYOONEEE!!! | Rogue's Minion-Hunting Season ", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T19:31:23+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-25T10:43:55+00:00", "description_md": "<br>\r\n\r\nThis is more or less a classic **minion summoning/hunting ** shell focused on [No Quarter](/card/28013) and [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017).

You can pump those numbers up if you want, but I would't worry about it too much.\r\n\r\n- You can **recur [No Quarter](/card/28013)** by attaching [Touched](/card/38002) to one of the Aggression allies and playing [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009). I found this made the deck's strategy very consistent.\r\n\r\n- Not playing [The X-Jet](/card/36023) because it's slightly too expensive for our curve and [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) does the job. We also have both [Deft Focus](/card/16024) and [X-Gene](/card/38019), which gives us a chance to **dedicate more resources to our Aggression** cards.\r\n\r\n- Still got the [Dive Bomb](/card/17028) + [Honed Technique](/card/28017) combo here but it's not our plan A. If it was, we'd bring more 1 or 2 extra allies to make sure we're always aerial.\r\n\r\n- [Hall of Heroes](/card/25016) is a **consistent card draw engine** thanks to Professor X, Psylocke and Goin' Rogue all being able to confuse the villain.\r\n\r\n- I was initially playing [\"Bring It!\"](/card/19030) on this but after a lot of denial, I decided to cut it. I wasn't drawing much off it. Although Rogue can clean up minions fast, there's more consistent sources of card draw and **you don't really want to pile up too many of them**. Vision and Thor are better at using that card because they can either ignore minions entirely or have AOE effects. We really just want the benefits of summoning and killing them, **we don't gain anything by collecting them**. [\"Bring It!\"](/card/19030) is not a physical resource for [No Quarter](/card/28013) and it's not a mental resource for [Honed Technique](/card/28017), so we're fine without it. YMMV, obviously.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nI did well with this deck in true solo but where it really shines is in multiplayer or 2-handed where your sole purpose can be to hunt down minions.<center>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n![img2](https://media2.giphy.com/media/sPCYDJfm9CZUonox5Z/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611f086b473da7f59d690f3a2a9f3399a730a314ff4&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)\r\n\r\n</center>", "user_id": 15361, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01055": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "04040": 1, "06017": 1, "10018": 1, "16024": 1, "16043": 3, "17028": 2, "18011": 1, "25014": 1, "28013": 3, "28017": 1, "32019": 1, "32041": 1, "35013": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26344, "name": "Rogue - Back to Basics", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T19:34:33+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-28T15:16:38+00:00", "description_md": "This deck doesn\u2019t need to much of an explanation.

We can attach [Touched](/card/38002) to a Leadership ally to consistently recur our essential blue events and restart our loops. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n- Use [Call for Aid](/card/12015) to consistently find [Kaluu](/card/21014) and/or [Black Panther](/card/23012), the only Avengers in the deck. \r\n\r\n- Kaluu (or [Adam Warlock](/card/17011)) will give you access to the Mystic trait so you can have play [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) and [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026). Kaluu is more useful by himself, but since we have lots of discard pile synergies, Adam doesn't really hurt you too bad.\r\n\r\n- We won't feel sorry about chucking our other allies in the bin while milling our deck because [Make the Call](/card/01071) will let us recur them. Don't panic [Make the Call](/card/01071) itself ends up there, since...\r\n\r\n- ...[Black Panther](/card/23012) is here to let you grab it right back. You can also reuse [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) this way. Put [Beast](/card/33011) into play for 3ER and get yourself a double resource as a bonus. Absolute stonks.\r\n \r\n- **We have plenty of 'enters play' effects** here to payoff [Rapid Response](/card/08031). Recycle [Nick Fury](/card/01084), [Kaluu](/card/21014) and [Maria Hill](/card/01067) to draw as much as you want. Blank problematic villain cards ad infinitum with [Vivian](/card/29024). Confuse-lock the villain with [Professor X](/card/32019) and [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005). Recycle your double resources with [Beast](/card/33011). And [Black Panther](/card/23012) beautifully restarts any of your combos. This deck durdles a little, yes, but it's obscenely fun.\r\n\r\n<br><center>\r\n\r\n![img2](https://i.imgur.com/SyAw7MT.png)\r\n\r\n<br></center>\r\n\r\nThis list is fairly simple to play, but you'll always have **tons of options**, so it's important to think ahead a little instead of just going for raw value:\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n- **Setup properly**. Put down your resource generators. Mulligan aggressively for [Kaluu](/card/21014) or [Call for Aid](/card/12015) so you can play [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026).\r\n\r\n- Hold off on [Summoning Spell](/card/21055) if you already have your expensive allies in the discard pile. It might not be an efficient use of your resources.\r\n\r\n- Avoid chumping with your Mystics unless [Rapid Response](/card/08031) is out. **There's enough ways to Confuse the villain here**, so you can usually take a few hits.\r\n\r\n- For obvious reasons, you'll see more than encounter cards than usual with this list. **Know what a stable board looks like and know when to push.** [Southern Cross](/card/38006) will do wonders on the villain's health.\r\n\r\n- Throwing [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026) on the trash does happen and it sucks. The deck works fine without it since you can still draw a ton, but it's best to mulligan aggressively for it and keep it in your hand if you have to. Otherwise, there's always the next deck pass. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nSeriously, _give this list a try_. It's impossible to beat Cyclops as the definitive X-Men Leadership Hero, but this deck can be just as pleasant to pilot.\r\n\r\n**Note:** whether or not you choose to count Touched towards the minimum deck size is up to you.\r\n\r\n<br><center>\r\n\r\n![img2](https://media3.giphy.com/media/LnoyB4lxdkHYq04A8D/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611ad45fec28bbc39805afad5df9f176f7f2c87ad98&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)\r\n\r\n<br></center>", "user_id": 15361, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01067": 1, "01071": 2, "01072": 2, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "08031": 2, "09026": 1, "12015": 2, "16024": 1, "17011": 1, "21014": 1, "21055": 1, "23012": 1, "29024": 1, "32020": 1, "33011": 1, "37017": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26346, "name": "\"We.

I mostly play Expert and prefer some tension in my games, so I don't mind having it stick around. With [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) + [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) + [R&D Facility](/card/29020) you can do** 12 damage **with a single [Go All Out](/card/29017). Add to that the fact that you have +10 hit points and a lot of allies to block with, **the extra encounter cards end up feeling harmless**... unless you get caught in some Surge-fest, obviously.\r\n\r\n- Important advice, though: **do not play [Symbiote Suit](/card/27191) during your first deck pass unless your board is stable**. Playing it on turn 1 is inviting certain death. I'll usually play it on a second pass once I have my economy established, [R&D Facility](/card/29020), [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) and 1 or 2 allies.\r\n\r\n- In the right shell, and this is one of them, [Earth's Mightiest Heroes](/card/04022) is a ton of value and just about **one of the best things you can do with your allies** besides [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017). You can exhaust a cheap friend like [Stinger](/card/12014) and use your basic hero powers after a [Go All Out](/card/29017) (or play another one if you have it in hand, ofc).\r\n \r\n- [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) is one of the stars of this show. This card is nuts, it's just **so much value for 2ER**! It will make [Go All Out](/card/29017) even sillier.\r\n\r\n- [R&D Facility](/card/29020) is a **staple** in this archetype for a reason. We're only playing a copy so we can play as many Avengers as possible, but you can run more if you want. The requirement can be annoying, but you have plenty of printed Mental resources here and [The X-Jet](/card/32020) to help. In a similar fashion, you shouldn't worry too much about the Energy requirement on [Go All Out](/card/29017). \r\n\r\n- Not including [Push Ahead](/card/29018) because Rogue doesn't struggle much with threat thanks to [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005) and her jacket.\r\n\r\n- Allies are up to your taste, just make sure you got enough Avengers. [Black Panther](/card/23012) or [Hawkeye](/card/01066) are particularly solid, though expensive. **Don't forget** you need [Touched](/card/38002) on another Avenger before you can play [Stinger](/card/12014).\r\n\r\n<br><center>\r\n\r\n![img2](https://imgur.com/16djNrT.png)\r\n\r\n_Don't mind Rogue, she's just beating up Earth's Mightiest Heroes._\r\n\r\n<br></center>", "user_id": 15361, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01066": 1, "01072": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "03013": 1, "04022": 3, "12011": 1, "12014": 1, "16024": 1, "21013": 1, "21014": 1, "21019": 1, "23012": 1, "27191": 1, "29017": 3, "29020": 1, "32020": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26347, "name": "Gambit - Big Pinging", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T19:41:47+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-24T19:41:47+00:00", "description_md": "This Gambit deck is all about attack events.

Use your hero actions for defending to stay in hero form as long as possible. You also have two Shield Block's which absorb one attack. If you are getting attacked multiple times in a single turn you can use the Action on your Hero side to reset Cap to block again. Flip over to heal and use your Alter ego effect. This deck requires a lot of build up but has an incredible pay off once developed as you will have so many cards on the board that the rest of your deck will mostly have ready's for your Yondu. As this deck's biggest weakness is the death of your units I added some form of healing (in the form of another reset) if needed as Yondu and Blade don't take consequential damage.

Today we're going through a Justice variant of Gambit decks! \r\n\r\nThe twist here, is that we're doubling down on [Remy Lebeau](/card/37001b)'s ability to deal with threat as the Thief Extraordinaire! \r\n\r\nIt's inconsistent? Well, why don't we make it more consistent! \r\n\r\n> \"Charge de card. Throw de card. Stack de deck?\" \r\n\r\nWell, how can we go about this? [Remy Lebeau](/card/37001b) has great synergy with cards like [Global Logistics](/card/27043) & [Blindfold](/card/33014). We can also use this time in AE for a little [Breaking and Entering](/card/37015) courtesy of [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003).  And maybe we could even leave a little gift in the form of a [Pulse Grenade](/card/17023) in case we don't like what we see. \r\n\r\n## That's all good and well for Remy, but what about [Gambit](/card/37001a)?\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have an abundance of Superpowers in the form of [Charged Card](/card/37006), [Royal Flush](/card/37007), [Natural Agility](/card/37008). But that's not a lot of damage for someone like Gambit, is it?\r\n\r\nHow about we learn a little something from [Mutant Education](/card/37021) and recycle our best cards! This also includes [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010) which is why we lack resources. It's a double-whammy of Charge counters and resources! \r\n\r\nIF you're wondering, [Field Agent](/card/27044) is here just as some fodder for [Quake](/card/08012) or [Monica Chang](/card/27040) and then you can leave one counter on it to use for [Global Logistics](/card/27043). \r\n\r\n##  Closing Thoughts. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe main aim of the deck was to try out a new way to really ramp-up a character's theme and goals with their abilities. Sure, it won't pack as much punch as Aggression, but you can really avoid some tough Encounters and keep a good handle on threat as you recycle your [Royal Flush](/card/37007) and [Charged Card](/card/37006)s over and over. \r\n\r\n## When it comes to Gambit, the house always wins.", "user_id": 11464, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01060": 3, "01064": 1, "01092": 1, "04049": 3, "08012": 1, "16024": 1, "17023": 2, "27040": 1, "27043": 3, "27044": 1, "32049": 1, "33014": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37015": 3, "37021": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26359, "name": "Aggressive Thief | Honed Gambit", "date_creation": "2023-02-24T23:14:19+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-24T23:14:27+00:00", "description_md": "Honed Technique + Warrior Skill + Aggressive Energy + Throw de Card = Profit", "user_id": 13435, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01050": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "04040": 1, "05030": 2, "10018": 1, "13012": 1, "13013": 2, "16024": 1, "25013": 1, "25014": 1, "28014": 2, "28017": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32047": 2, "35014": 1, "35016": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37030": 1, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": ""}], [{"id": 26360, "name": "Bob and Weave", "date_creation": "2023-02-25T00:03:03+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-25T00:03:03+00:00", "description_md": "Keep the pressure on and don't get hit.", "user_id": 28922, "investigator_code": "32030a", "investigator_name": "Shadowcat", "slots": {"01055": 2, "01057": 1, "01088": 1, "01090": 1, "04043": 3, "10018": 1, "13014": 3, "16024": 1, "18012": 2, "28016": 2, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32031a": 1, "32032": 1, "32033": 1, "32034": 1, "32035": 1, "32036": 2, "32037": 3, "32038": 2, "32039": 2, "32040": 2, "32042": 1, "32051": 2, "35013": 1, "35018": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "8.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26362, "name": "Space Knights", "date_creation": "2023-02-25T00:05:52+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-25T00:05:52+00:00", "description_md": "Make a big Yondu and blast passively. \r\nHas beaten Mad Titan's Shadow Expert without dropping below 5hp.", "user_id": 28922, "investigator_code": "20001a", "investigator_name": "Venom", "slots": {"01073": 1, "01074": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01092": 1, "04016": 1, "08031": 1, "13024": 2, "16019": 1, "16047": 1, "17013": 1, "17015": 2, "17019": 1, "17022": 1, "18019": 1, "19020": 1, "20002": 2, "20003": 2, "20004": 1, "20005": 3, "20006": 2, "20007": 1, "20008": 1, "20009": 1, "20010": 2, "20016": 1, "20027": 2, "21053": 1, "21065": 1, "23035": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "7.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26363, "name": "Tiny Gods", "date_creation": "2023-02-25T00:06:52+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-25T21:53:18+00:00", "description_md": "Wings and Honed Technique for big dive bombs.", "user_id": 28922, "investigator_code": "13001a", "investigator_name": "Wasp", "slots": {"01055": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "05030": 3, "06017": 1, "10018": 1, "13002": 1, "13003": 2, "13004": 3, "13005": 2, "13006": 2, "13007": 2, "13008": 1, "13009": 1, "13010": 1, "13011": 1, "13012": 1, "13013": 3, "17028": 3, "18011": 1, "25013": 1, "28017": 1, "29027": 1, "35018": 3}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26364, "name": "Teaching Moment", "date_creation": "2023-02-25T00:07:41+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-25T00:07:41+00:00", "description_md": "Get full use out of instruction.

The goal is to Med Lab Rogue infinitely.   Utopia is 100% used to ready the exhausted Med Lab character.   Gambit should flip every turn, so a lot of his cards need to function under this premise.  You don't need to chump block too much.  Crew Quarters and X-Mansion do a rather good job of keeping Gambit healthy, since you are only being attacked once every two turns.  \r\n\r\nYou want to prioritize Med Lab in this list, Rogue can be fished out with Mutant Education or Pixie eventually.  Sometimes Rogue is at the bottom of your deck.  Weapon X has been great when Rogue is inevitably hiding at the bottom of the deck.  \r\n\r\nLets talk about Mutant Education.  It helps Gambit recycle Molecular Acceleration early game.  Later on you'll probably want to finish the game with recycled Charged cards.  Honorable mention using Creole Charmer when applicable (some villains are immune or less concerned).  Obviously, keeping Rogue around is nice whenever possible.  A cantrip is extremely powerful in all card games.  You can decide to return nothing, thus thinning your deck.   This is optimal when searching for specific cards.   For example, early game you are looking for the danger room engine + Med lab.  Then you need Rogue.  Champions isn't a 1 for 1 comparison to other card games though.  For example, getting a double resource is somewhat equal to drawing two cards.  More molecular accelerations early game means you are setting up for end game more quickly/efficiently.  I can see people arguing that X-mansion is too much of a tax for Gambit.  Those people are not entirely wrong, but Weapon X is too good to pass up.  Gambit's identity cards are great, and sometimes drawing a card is just a free resource to pay for something else.\r\n\r\nMirage + Danger Room Training = Often can stun villains\r\nPixie + Danger room Training = She can attack and fall into the med lab next turn (or block)\r\n\r\nGambit works rather well with other X-men, since he's not too greedy with cards.  X-mansion isn't that popular outside of Gambit.  You can opt to share Danger Room.  Let the other X-men player put Utopia in play (they might need the +1 ally limit).   Moira MacTaggert is designed for sharing, which is phenomenal.\r\n\r\nLastly, it seems Med Lab works on your teammate's allies?   This is certainly interesting!

I built it to use Psionic cards outside the only other option, Phoenix, and [Psychic Kicker](/card/34034) turns Rogue into a cheerleader for the rest of her team. It takes some set-up because the only ways to give Rogue the Psionic trait are to attach [Touched](/card/38002) to either [Mirage](/card/36015) or [Professor X](/card/37017). Prof doesn't like to stick around for long so [Make the Call](/card/01071) is crucial to bring him back. Mirage is less prone to abandon you but she's not exactly built to hang out forever either. Since the cute combo is a small part of the deck, the rest is general Leadership goodness that works just fine without Kicker.\r\n\r\nThe Plan\r\n[Team Training](/card/04016) and [Uncanny X-Men](/card/36018) provide extra HP, allowing the team more opportunities to attack or thwart before readying from Kicker. [Med Lab](/card/38028) allows an overexerted ally to hang out on the sidelines a bit while they wait to get back in the game. \r\n\r\n[Effective Leadership](/card/36021) and [Leadership Skill](/card/36019) are there to pump an ally's spirits (and stats). EL works better with Kicker since its stat boost lasts throughout the phase. It can be tutored by [Beast](/card/33011) but you'll need a resource-heavy hand and/or Uncanny X-Men/[Team Training](/card/04016) on the board in order to play a second ally with EL on the same turn. Leadership Skill can be handy to finish off something just out of reach for an ally, or to set something up for someone else to finish off. Extra readying from [Utopia](/card/36024) is always welcome, though you're not likely to make use of the extra ally slot.\r\n\r\nThe Team\r\n[Angel](/card/33019) is a good attacker and cheap blocker. Beast is a flexible attacker or thwarter with a rebate. [Gentle](/card/36016) has a nice 3 ATK to deal with minions and a decent amount of HP to absorb consequential damage if you need to hit the villain. Mirage and Prof are the lynchpins of the combo and great thwarters as well. [Pixie](/card/36017) is cheap and another way to get those lynchpins back in hand when needed. Unfortunately, Make the Call doesn't play nicely with cost reductions like Uncanny or Angel since printed cost needs to be paid. \r\n\r\nRogue is strong enough to carry the team with her base stats and efficient events when not borrowing the Psionic trait. Touched will typically go on the villain unless you need more output from [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005) and [Southern Cross](/card/38006). Damage prevention and Tough status from [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008) help preserve allies on the board. using [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) while Mirage is Touched can bring Kicker back to get an extra burst from an ally.

Y reafirmo despu\u00e9s de probar que en multi es mucho m\u00e1s \u00fatil [Ataque preventivo](/card/05014) o [Desaf\u00edo](/card/26018) que [Not Today!](/card/38016), esta \u00faltima es mejor para jugar en solo.\r\n\r\n**_Descripci\u00f3n original_**\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nGambito vino a protegernos a todos!! Este es un mazo que ten\u00eda calentito en mi cabeza desde el d\u00eda del anuncio de Gambito hace 4 meses. Un personaje que tiene 3 de DEF base, con una carta propia para recuperarse tras defender y ese bastoncito para quitar duros, andaba pidiendo un mazo de defensa total a gritos. \r\n\r\nPues en este caso tenemos un kit bastante b\u00e1sico de eventos de Defensa total, con [Defensa desesperada](/card/09015), [Ni un paso atr\u00e1s](/card/14014) y la nueva cartita que causa sensaci\u00f3n [Not Today!](/card/38016). La primera es obvia para multi, aunque tengas tu armadura, necesitas asegurarte que vas a terminar preparado para otros ataques de tus compa\u00f1eros y ese +2 en defensa tira muy bien. Despu\u00e9s, Ni un paso atr\u00e1s viene muy bien para defender al siguiente h\u00e9roe sin tener que agotarte, aunque obviamente es una carta muy dependiente de si juegas un villano con Tes\u00f3n/Firmeza. En ese caso meter\u00eda 3 copias de [Desaf\u00edo](/card/26018), ya que puedes usarlo cuando ataque a otros y as\u00ed controlas mucho m\u00e1s el da\u00f1o que va a entrar. La carta de [Not Today!](/card/38016) es quiz\u00e1s la m\u00e1s flexible, puesto que salvo que sea un escenario exigente de amenaza, se supone que a 4 habr\u00e1 una persona en Justicia encargada de los planes. En ese caso podr\u00edamos meter [Ataque preventivo](/card/05014), de nuevo para controlar el da\u00f1o que entra y de paso hacerle da\u00f1o al villano. Una carta peculiar que he a\u00f1adido por recomendaci\u00f3n de mi queridisimo George es [Pu\u00f1etazo potente](/card/32014), puesto que esta carta, junto a los contadores y [Gambit's Staff](/card/37004), nos va a permitir dar un golpe de hasta 8 de vida para matar esbirros (o incluso pasar al villano de fase) y que se considere defensa perfecta, lo cual nos da muchisimo control sobre los esbirros. \r\n\r\nEn cuanto a Mejoras, obviamente vamos a tener el [Chaleco blindado](/card/01081) e [Imperturbable](/card/09020), puesto que va a permitir nuestro motor de robo cuando hagamos defensa completa. A esto hay que sumarle un par de [Ind\u00f3mito](/card/01082), que nos van a permitir defender m\u00e1s veces en el turno del villano y [Judoka Skill](/card/38014), que nos permite rebajar ese ataque del villano para controlar a\u00fan m\u00e1s el da\u00f1o entrante. Por \u00faltimo, para pagar los eventos de Defensa, tenemos [Nervios de acero](/card/14017). Esta puede quiz\u00e1s intercambiarse con [Energ\u00eda defensiva](/card/32018), haciendo un reajuste de las cartas de recursos. \r\n\r\nRespecto a Aliados, he metido dos aliados que entran con duro, [Armor](/card/38012) y [Polaris](/card/32012), lo cual nos va asegurar la defensa de los compa\u00f1eros, sumado a la propia P\u00edcara, que entrar\u00e1 casi siempre con coste 0. Tambi\u00e9n he metido a Bobby [Iceman](/card/38010), para as\u00ed tener un poco m\u00e1s de control sobre los esbirros y a [Yocasta](/card/26013), ya que me parece b\u00e1sica en un mazo de defensa total para buscar cartas en el momento adecuado, en este caso sobre todo [Natural Agility](/card/37008). \r\n\r\nY hablando de \u00e9sta carta, la jugabilidad del propio Gambito en este caso se centra bastante en acumular contadores todos los turnos para que cuando usemos [Natural Agility](/card/37008) tengamos una defensa descomunal. Hay que priorizar la [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005) por el tema de prepararse y la prioridad de tus b\u00e1sicos ser\u00e1n DEF>>>ATQ>INT. No ir\u00e1s tanto a alter ego, por lo que si que puede pasar que anules un poco la propia mec\u00e1nica de alter ego, pero siempre puedes intentar cuadrarlo con el resto de compa\u00f1eros. \r\n\r\nY por aqu\u00ed, mi macito del franc\u00e9s que menos odio despu\u00e9s de Karim Benzema. \u00a1Un saludo y mover ficha para todos!", "user_id": 20712, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01081": 1, "01082": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "05023": 1, "09015": 3, "09020": 1, "14014": 3, "14017": 1, "26013": 1, "32012": 1, "32014": 3, "32020": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "38010": 1, "38012": 1, "38014": 2, "38016": 3}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}", "tags": "multiplayer"}, {"id": 26372, "name": "Naipes explosivos [SdC]", "date_creation": "2023-02-25T16:04:44+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-25T16:04:44+00:00", "description_md": "Mejora del precon orientado a cambiar todos los turnos entre AE y H\u00e9roe.

One of the more interesting builds I was thinking about was the Overkill build.\r\n\r\nSince she can get Overkill on any of her attacks as long as [Touched](/card/38002) is attached to a minion it opens up a ton of options for her versatility. I wanted to maximize it.\r\n\r\nWith an overkill build the goal is to get as much damage rolling to the villain as possible. [Follow Through](/card/16045) helps with that as it increases every instance of excess damage by one. This improves our overkill damage - especially once we get 3x out there.\r\n\r\nNow how do we exploit [Follow Through](/card/16045)? Since every instance of excess damage is increased, we just need to find a way to cause multiple instances of excess damage, cue [Team Strike](/card/32045). \r\n\r\n[Team Strike](/card/32045) allows us exhaust our hero and any number of Xmen allies to spread the sum total of their attack to enemies in play. Ding Ding, we have a spread. What we need to do is get out our big swingers, [Wolverine](/card/32041) and [Colossus](/card/32001a) then fill our third slot with one of the other allies we have in our arsenal. \r\n\r\nCombo this with a [Combat Training](/card/01057) on [Rogue](/card/38001a) and [Boot Camp](/card/13016) to improve our allies attack, our one cost [Team Strike](/card/32045) is now hitting for 14 damage. \r\n\r\nSince this can be spread out over the different enemies, and we have overkill from [Touched](/card/38002), then all we need to do is assign 1 damage more than each minion's health and that one damage turns into four with the [Follow Through](/card/16045) boost - all with overkill! \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nOn the field we have 3 minions all with three health. We play our [Team Strike](/card/32045) for 14 damage and assign four damage to each of the minions and 2 damage to the villain. The minions get cleared and we have 3 instances of 4 damage rolling to the villain giving us 14 damage total.\r\n\r\nThat one team strike, took out three minions and threw 14 damage at the villain.\r\n\r\nWe are clearing the field of minions and slamming the villain for massive amounts of damage.\r\n\r\nThis probably works best in multiplayer scenarios, but can work well in solo play as well. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!

To make use of all the confusion, we are also packing [Scare Tactic](/card/20012), combine that with his hero ability to add to its damage you can confuse with 3 damage, then scare tactic with 6 damage.

A kto jeszcze lubi jak si\u0119 inicjuje ataki na niego? Ano [Spider-Man](/card/01001a). Co prawda Peter ma w swoim arsenale tak\u017ce stun, nawet 2-turowy w postaci [Webbed Up](/card/01009), ale w tym decku zupe\u0142nie zapominamy o jego istnieniu. Synergia natomiast do\u015b\u0107 oczywista - mamy nasz\u0105 zdolno\u015b\u0107 dzi\u0119ki kt\u00f3rej dogrywamy kart\u0119, a maj\u0105c 4 defa je\u015bli liczy\u0107 [Armored Vest](/card/01081) jeste\u015bmy mocno pancerni i du\u017co rzadziej musimy si\u0119 zmienia\u0107 w Alter-Ego.

Tutaj z pomoc\u0105 przychodz\u0105 nasze [Web-Shooter](/card/01008), kolejny pow\u00f3d dla kt\u00f3rego paj\u0105k fajnie pasuje do Novy. Dodatkowo mamy 2x [Enhanced Reflexes](/card/05024). Generalnie fajnie mie\u0107 wi\u0119cej ni\u017c 1 \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142o amunicji, jako \u017ce Nova si\u0119 nie wyczerpuje przy zdolno\u015bci to mo\u017cemy \u015bmia\u0142o jej u\u017cywa\u0107 i na z\u0142olu i na minionach w tej samej turze, a nawet i kilku minionach je\u015bli jest taka potrzeba. Dodatkowo spora liczba naszych kart aspetkowych maj\u0105 piorunki same w sobie.\r\n\r\nCo jeszcze mamy dobrego:\r\n- mamy [Med Team](/card/01080) - osobi\u015bcie mocno lubi\u0119 leczenie w po\u0142\u0105czeniu z Nov\u0105. Sam Alexander to jeden z nielicznych sojusznik\u00f3w, gdzie naprawd\u0119 nam zale\u017cy, \u017ceby zosta\u0142 na stole - najlepiej przez ca\u0142\u0105 gr\u0119. Wi\u0119c po jakim\u015b czasie (a konkretnie 2 turach) mamy problem, \u017ce Novie si\u0119 ko\u0144cz\u0105 HPki do aktywacji. Med team to naprawia, czyli de facto zyskujemy dzi\u0119ki niemu dodatkowe 2 obra\u017cenia co tur\u0119. Dodatkowo mo\u017cemy co\u015b tam podleczy\u0107 nasze identity i tym samym jeszcze zmniejszy\u0107 czas sp\u0119dzony na Alter Ego.\r\n\r\n- [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) to ofensywno-defensywna karta, pomaga nam w momentach gdy jaki\u015b dmg wyjdzie z poza ram naszego defa oraz gdy si\u0119 przytrafi jaki\u015b nieoczekiwany direct damage. Przy okazji pomagaj\u0105c kontrolowa\u0107 st\u00f3\u0142 i powoli pcha\u0107 z\u0142ola w kierunku 0 hp.\r\n\r\n- [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014) karta podobna w za\u0142o\u017ceniach do poprzedniej. Pozwala nam d\u0142u\u017cej przetrwa\u0107 na stronie hero i jednocze\u015bnie wbija\u0107 obra\u017cenia.

W normalnych sytuacjach najcz\u0119\u015bciej [Armored Vest](/card/01081) + [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) wystarczaj\u0105ce by nie traci\u0107 naszego \u017cycia.\r\n\r\n- ok, to tyle o kartach kt\u00f3re jako takie wspomagaj\u0105 archetyp Novy pozosta\u0142e to po prostu dobre na t\u0105 chwil\u0119 karciochy. Pierwsz\u0105 z nich i IMO najwa\u017cniejsz\u0105 jest [Lockjaw](/card/05018). Spider-man na protekcji przed pakietem z [Ms. Marvel](/card/05001a) mia\u0142 sporo problem\u00f3w z radzeniem sobie z zagro\u017ceniem. Bazowo mamy 1 thw, a i tak ca\u0142a koncepcja polega na tym, \u017ce nasz\u0105 aktywacj\u0119 po\u015bwi\u0119camy co tur\u0119 na obron\u0119. Nasz bazowy skill od zbijania zagro\u017cenia, czyli [Spider-Tracer](/card/01007) jest sytuacyjny, bez minion\u00f3w go nawet nie zagramy. Sama protekcja nam w tym na ten moment nie pomaga. I co z tego \u017ce sobie genialnie rodzimy z obron\u0105 jak przegramy przez zalanie side schemami? Piesio poprawia nam sytuacje w tej kwestii.\r\n\r\n- [Black Widow](/card/01075) r\u00f3wnie\u017c pomaga nam z thw a dodatkowo chroni przed tymi kartami treachery z kt\u00f3rymi sobie s\u0142abo radzimy czyli g\u0142\u00f3wnie [Advance](/card/01186) oraz [Masterplan](/card/01192)\r\n\r\n- [Luke Cage](/card/01076) to po prostu twardy kole\u015b z mn\u00f3stwem aktywacji, \u017caden priorytet je\u015bli chodzi o nasze karciochy, ale czasami si\u0119 przydaje.\r\n\r\n- [Endurance](/card/05023) te\u017c fajnie wpasowuje si\u0119 w posta\u0107 paj\u0105ka. Te 3 hp wi\u0119cej przy jego zdolno\u015bciach defensywny mo\u017ce si\u0119 przy\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 nawet na od\u0142o\u017cenie w czasie zmiany na AE o kilka tur. Dodatkowo maj\u0105c 13 max hp du\u017co \u0142atwiej jest wyci\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 pe\u0142ne valie z [Aunt May](/card/01006).\r\n\r\n- opr\u00f3cz tego mamy karty, kt\u00f3re na chwile obecn\u0105, przy ma\u0142ej puli kart jeszcze s\u0105 zawsze dobre, czyli [Nick Fury](/card/01084), [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091) oraz [Helicarrier](/card/01092).\r\n\r\nI tak by wygl\u0105da\u0142 nasz deck. To deck pod Nov\u0119 wi\u0119c wypada\u0142oby GP szybko dobra\u0107 i zagra\u0107, a potem pilnowa\u0107, by sta\u0142 jak najd\u0142u\u017cej na stole. Znajomo\u015b\u0107 encounter kart dost\u0119pnych w danym scenariuszu jest ty najwi\u0119kszym przyjacielem. Maj\u0105c Aiexandra powoli zaczynamy zabaw\u0119, najpierw nie\u015bmia\u0142o skupiaj\u0105c si\u0119 g\u0142\u00f3wnie na strzelaniu w miniony. W mi\u0119dzyczasie dogrywamy nasze karty-amunicje pod pioruny, podkr\u0119camy defensyw\u0119 i mo\u017cemy ju\u017c szale\u0107.

Sharon's in a coma in the ICU. Who are you paging??\"_\r\n\r\n![Dr. Danvers](https://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/43000000/Carol-Danvers-Captain-Marvel-2019-marvels-captain-marvel-43042224-268-170.gif)\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of Rogue's release, I thought it would be fun to revisit Captain Marvel given the two characters' [complicated history](https://nerdist.com/article/captain-marvel-x-mens-rogue-twisted-history/). I was also looking for a platform to play with [Med Lab](/card/38028). Lucky for me, if you want to make an aspect card look good, just play it in a Captain Marvel deck. But let me sell you on why this deck works and why this is an especially fun platform for Med Lab.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Abuse AE for card draw; frequency of AE makes Med Lab easy to use; Med Lab keeps high value allies (White Tiger, Spider-Woman) in rotation at a discount to Make the Call and without needing to be in hero mode like Rapid Response.\r\n\r\nTo get there, we need to lift up the hood and take a close look at the engine. \r\n\r\n### Go, go, go: Agent 13, Command Teams, and Alpha Flight Station\r\n\r\nFun fact: [Alpha Flight Station](/card/01015) is SHIELD traited. (This is known, but maybe not as widely as it should be!) So every time Agent 13 thwarts (or attacks, if you MUST), she readies Alpha Flight Station. In AE, this is about as fast as deck acceleration gets, especially when you [Command Team](/card/23016) to ready her a few times. So spending time in AE is even more valuable than the free card draw from Carol Danvers' Commander ability might suggest. This is important because spending time in AE is how we'll get value from Med Lab. \r\n\r\n### Stay alive: Spider-Woman\r\n\r\nJessica Drew helps us spend more time in AE greedily drawing through our decks like power hungry card goblins. She lands her confuse and suddenly with [Med Lab](/card/38028), her 2 health is an asset, not a liability. She's two quick activations away from some restorative intravenous fluids. (If you want get really greedy, you can add [Professor X](/card/32019) but I haven't found any more confuse that necessary.) Your high thwart allies and the occasional confuse from Spider-Woman are plenty to keep you building your board state from the safety of AE. \r\n\r\n### Bling for days: Beast, White Tiger, Nick Fury, and economy Supports\r\n\r\nThis deck has pricy allies in all directions. Carol's inherent draw is supplemented by her Energy Absorption triple resource, [Beast](/card/33011) fetching it, and draw allies, to make it all work. Quincarrier, Helicarrier, and Avengers Mansion are all relatively easy plays to continue to build your board state. Med Lab itself is an economy card. We have [Make the Call](/card/01071) to recur allies from discard, but what Med Lab makes those allies cheaper to play as we don't need them in hand. Even if you don't need the \"from your hand\" effects, Med Lab creates value. But White Tiger makes full use of Med Lab and keeps you drawing. And spamming Beast is especially helpful to get a couple allies down to power up your [Band Together](/card/21018). \r\n\r\nWhy 3x Band Together and not the other doubles you might ask?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Seal the deal: Energy Channel, Vision, Dum Dum Dugan\r\n\r\nAs you gobble cards cookie monster-style (nom nom nom) with Alpha Flight Station, you might be asking, but why? How do I win? \r\n\r\nThree ways: 1. Energy Channel, 2. Big allies, 3. Photonic Blast as icing. Every time you find yourself with Energy odds and ends, dump them into Energy Channel for later. It's your savings account. Find yourself with a full Energy Channel and another in hand? Pop up to dump your savings in the form of 10 damage and play your second. Vision, Dum Dum Dugan dropping late game with 2-3 Command Teams is also extremely valuable to help close games. I've done 35 damage in a round. And this is why we're using Band Together instead of the doubles - when you want to drop two Energy Channel bombs in a round, you want the energy resources, and Carol's card draw and filtered draw with Alpha Flight Station makes up for Band Together whiffs in the first couple turns. \r\n\r\n### Until next time ...\r\n\r\nThe deck's 41 cards - you cut one. :)", "user_id": 1901, "investigator_code": "01010a", "investigator_name": "Captain Marvel", "slots": {"01011": 1, "01012": 3, "01013": 3, "01014": 2, "01015": 1, "01016": 1, "01017": 2, "01018": 2, "01067": 1, "01068": 1, "01071": 3, "01073": 1, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01091": 1, "01092": 1, "04016": 1, "08023": 1, "08031": 1, "21013": 1, "21018": 3, "23016": 3, "27046": 1, "27047": 1, "27055": 1, "33011": 1, "38028": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26418, "name": "\u201cPlay Hex Bolt and See What Happens\u201d", "date_creation": "2023-02-26T14:44:37+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-26T14:44:37+00:00", "description_md": "Just playtesting on TTS.", "user_id": 15361, "investigator_code": "15001a", "investigator_name": "Scarlet Witch", "slots": {"01083": 1, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "01092": 1, "04049": 3, "06031": 1, "08023": 1, "09026": 1, "13018": 1, "13024": 2, "15002": 1, "15003": 1, "15004": 4, "15005": 3, "15006": 1, "15007": 1, "15008": 3, "15009": 1, "15011": 1, "15019": 3, "16024": 1, "21050": 1, "22011": 1, "22015": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26419, "name": "Ace Up His Sleeve", "date_creation": "2023-02-26T14:45:39+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-27T01:00:19+00:00", "description_md": "<i>\"The gentleman assumes the pot is his to win... but I have a literal ace up my sleeve.\"</i> ~X-Men, Vol 2 5\r\n\r\n<b><u>I. Summary and Theme</u></b>\r\n\r\nThis deck combines Gambit's high DEF with the Protection aspect to do damage and thwarting on the villain's turn. \r\n\r\n<b><u>II. Mulligan and Building the Support/Upgrade \"Engine\"</u></b>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Since this deck relies on Gambit defending and taking no damage, [Armored Vest](/card/01081) is the highest priority, giving Gambit a DEF of 4.</li>\r\n<li>The second priority is x3 copies of [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017), since Gambit has few thwarting options on his Hero side.</li>\r\n<li>There are times where an enemy may attack Gambit for 5+ damage. [Judoka Skill](/card/38014) will help reduce the damage to 0 so that he can use cards like [Not Today!](/card/38016), [Hard to Ignore](/card/16017), [Unflappable](/card/09020), and [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005).</li>\r\n<li>[Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005) will allow Gambit to defend and potentially ready again.</li>\r\n<li>[The X-Jet](/card/32020) will help pay for cards.</li>\r\n<li>[Nerves of Steel](/card/14017) will help pay for [Not Today!](/card/38016) and [Powerful Punch](/card/32014).</li>\r\n<li>[Endurance](/card/05023) increases Gambit's low HP to a maximum of 12.</li>\r\n<li>[Gambit's Staff](/card/37004) will deal 1 damage when he is attacked.</li>\r\n<li>[Deft Focus](/card/16024) is a low priority early in the game, but will eventually help pay for [Charged Card](/card/37006) and [Royal Flush](/card/37007).</li>\r\n<li>[Unflappable](/card/09020) will help increase card draw.</li>\r\n<li>This deck doesn't rely on Gambit being in alter-ego mode often, but if necessary, [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) will help with thwarting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<b><u>III. Allies</u></b>\r\n\r\nFor Gambit, I chose thematic X-Men allies.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>[Armor](/card/38012) is a cheap ally good for \"chump blocking\" because she starts with a tough status card.</li>\r\n<li>[Iceman](/card/38010) helps delay minions by stunning them.</li>\r\n<li>[Polaris](/card/32012) helps give you or another ally tough status.</li>\r\n<li>[Professor X](/card/32019) is great. He can confuse the villain, stun a minion, or ready an X-Men character. Additionally, he THW for 3 and can \"chump block\" before leaving.</li>\r\n<li>[Rogue](/card/37002) is incredible because she can be played for cheap if not free (presuming that Gambit has some charge counters built up.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<b><u>IV. Strategy</u></b>\r\n\r\nDuring the Hero Phase:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Remember to use Gambit's \"Charge de Card\" hero ability.</li>\r\n<li>Build up your \"engine.\"</li>\r\n<li>Eventually, your engine will be built (or mostly built), and you will have a greater likelihood of using [Charged Card](/card/37006) and [Royal Flush](/card/37007).</li>\r\n<li>Gambit has a base ATK of 2 and THW of 1.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nDuring the Villain Phase:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Most of Gambit's action takes place on the villain's turn. DEF with Gambit every turn, attempting to take 0 damage.</li>\r\n<li>Even when an enemy does 5+ damage, this can be reduced/prevented with [Judoka Skill](/card/38014) and [Natural Agility](/card/37008).

With 2 copies of these and the 3 basic resource cards, you have enough to pay for big cards while [The X-Jet](/card/36023) and [X-Gene](/card/38019) get into play.\r\n\r\nSince [The X-Jet](/card/36023) generates a <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> resource for a **X-Men** identity, play [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) on your hero to get the **X-Men** trait while in AE form, and also getting an extra HP. This also lets you ready in AE form when an **X-Men** ally enters play and [Utopia](/card/33020) is in the board, wich means you can thwart twice with your AE ability.\r\n\r\nUse you allies to ready you, block for you, and thwarting, leave the damage dealing to Gambit. [Angel](/card/33019) is a cheap block, [Storm](/card/34021) thwarts for 2 and can juggle 2 more threat between schemes, [Colossus](/card/32001a) comes in Tough, the same for [Rogue](/card/37002), who can also be played for 0 resources and lets you play [Beauty and the Thief](/card/37019). [Longshot](/card/35033) can benefit from your _Thief Extraordinaire_ ability if you need to remove a non-elite minion, [Professor X](/card/32019) is another Confused status card for the villain, and [Forge](/card/36022) helps setting up the board by fetching supports with the **X-Men** trait. \r\n\r\nThe only supports [Forge](/card/36022) can't fetch in this deck are [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018), who will get you an extra card everytime you flip to Hero form, and [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003), wich can also get you an extra card if played right.

What he does have, is very efficient access to toughness through his Steel Skin ability, [Bulletproof Protector](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32009) events, and [Organic Steel](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32006) upgrades. To this end, the power of [Mutant Education](https://marvelcdb.com/card/37021) comes to Colossus' rescue to provide ready access to his very strong and versatile kit. \r\n\r\nThe core of this build, then, is just the 3x [Mutant Education](https://marvelcdb.com/card/37021) and 3x [Limitless Stamina](https://marvelcdb.com/card/31023). Everything else is flexible. But this particular deck is meant to also make use of his very strong team-up with [Wolverine](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32041). [Wolverine](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32041) is already a powerhouse of an ally, and his synergy with [Fastball Special](https://marvelcdb.com/card/35023) and [X-Mansion](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32049) make him fit naturally into what this deck already wants (since [X-Mansion](/card/32049) powers up [Mutant Education](/card/37021)). \r\n\r\nThe rest of the upgrades just boost [Wolverine](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32041)'s and Colossus's attack, building up [Fastball Special](https://marvelcdb.com/card/35023) further; plus, [Deft Focus](https://marvelcdb.com/card/16024) is included for Colossus' recurring hero cards and [Limitless Stamina](https://marvelcdb.com/card/31023), with special emphasis on [Organic Steel](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32006) and [Steel Fist](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32008). [Unshakable](https://marvelcdb.com/card/31024) makes him very tough to lock down. \r\n\r\nA couple supports are sprinkled in to give even more attack and and a bit more economy with the [X-Jet](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32020). Also, [War Room](https://marvelcdb.com/card/37030) is a great include since [Wolverine](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32041) will be very sticky and a ready source of activating its response for some extra thwarting. \r\n\r\nFor allies, [Psylocke](https://marvelcdb.com/card/35013) is thrown in for even more ready confusion (and her cost is hardly noticeable once Colossus has a couple toughs and his [Titanium Muscles](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32005). [Magik](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32042) is included mostly for theme, but getting rid of minions is always a boon since they're less sources of pinging the toughs away. [Magik](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32042) could be substituted for [Sunfire](/card/35014), [Dust](/card/33012), or the always useful [Professor X](/card/32019) as you like. \r\n\r\nFinally, [Team Strike](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32045) has great synergy as a means of making use of your boosted ally attack for longer, and giving [Wolverine](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32041) a turn to regenerate more of his health. \r\n\r\nThe end result is a deck that can do everything you need. Colossus will go whole games without ever defending. He can thwart well with his boosted 2 THW stat and [Limitless Stamina](https://marvelcdb.com/card/31023), and his ladies [Shadowcat](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32002) and [Psylocke](https://marvelcdb.com/card/35013); and, he will shut down the villains schemes very consistently on his turns in alter-ego with confuse and [Armor Up](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32010). He and his team melt enemies of all sorts and once he is built you will have an overwhelming economy, getting tons of draw after stacking your hero kit on the bottom of your deck (with the power of education) and getting a ton of draw of from [Iron Will](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32004) with [Bulletproof Protector](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32009), [Steel Fist](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32008), and [Made of Rage](https://marvelcdb.com/card/32007).

You have to gather a team (heroes), put a plan (deck) together, do the setup (play upgrades/supports) - then try to pull the whole thing off!**\r\n\r\n**And no one knows more about heists than Thief Extraordinaire, [Remy Lebeau](/card/37001b).**\r\n\r\nTap into your worldwide network of thieves with [Global Logistics](/card/27043). Arranging the encounter deck has so many amazing uses!\r\n\r\n- Can we hijack boost icons for Gambit's alter-ego action? Yes, we can.\r\n- Can we smuggle in a star icon for [Longshot](/card/35033)? Yes, we can.\r\n- Can swipe some more boost icons for a classic Justice ally? Yes, [Wiccan](/card/15011).\r\n\r\nWith this deck, you're always the one pulling strings! Mastermind your very own heist from alter-ego, drop into hero form and steal away the villain's hp, then make a clean getaway back to alter-ego.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n_Note: This deck is designed as an all-rounder and is based around control, not as a specialist in threat removal. As of such, it's ideal for 1-2 player games! If you are bringing this to a 3-4 player game, make sure your other players are both happy and able to make significant contributions to threat removal._\r\n<hr>\r\n<img src=https://i.imgur.com/uVr468W.png alt=\"Gambit\">\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Setup**\r\n<hr>\r\nEvery thief needs the right tools. Prioritize [The X-Jet](/card/32020), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), [X-Mansion](/card/32049), or [Monica Chang](/card/27040) in your mulligan. If you can start with one of these, you'll be in a great place. [Forge](/card/36022) is also a great way to grab one of these early.\r\n\r\nAt some point, you want to get a SHIELD card in play and keep it in play - [Quake](/card/08012) or a [Surveillance Team](/card/01064) is ideal. And yet this is no SHIELD deck! Sure, you have a few corrupted agents on the team, but ultimately you only care about using their network. Get one SHIELD card in play and protect it, save at least 1 use or 1 hp, and use it to fuel [Global Logistics](/card/27043).\r\n\r\nWhoever said there was no honor among thieves clearly hadn't heard of [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035)! Combine it with [Mission Training](/card/34016) to make [Wiccan](/card/15011) the master thief he can be, potentially removing 2 threat and - with a little help - dealing 2-3 damage each turn. In a pinch, these make great targets for [Dazzler](/card/37012), [Longshot](/card/35033), and [Rogue](/card/37002) too.\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Heist**\r\n<hr>\r\nOnce you have a couple of resource generators in play and a SHIELD card out, you're ready to really begin.\r\n\r\nUse [Mutant Education](/card/37021) to keep [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) in the loop. Using confuses lets us dance in and out of alter-ego, and using our DEF as protection from the villain really lets us avoid blocking with our allies - and this build loves allies. You can't be a king without subjects, can you? Keeping [Wiccan](/card/15011) and [Longshot](/card/35033) in play gives you huge value.\r\n\r\nAnd while all this is going on, your Charge counters are building us. Hit minions from the shadows with [Stealth Strike](/card/08013) alongside your signature attacks, using counters efficiently to clear them. Why [Stealth Strike](/card/08013) over [Turn the Tide](/card/15015)? Because we aren't using Gambit to thwart directly in hero form.\r\n\r\nBit by bit, chip away at the villain's hp. [Plan B](/card/27024) can be especially effective and really adds up over time. And, when the coast is clear, hit them hard with some juicy uses of [Royal Flush](/card/37007)! Bring them down.\r\n\r\nIf you're starting to amass a lot of charge counters, start using them more. You might not _need_ to get overkill on [Charged Card](/card/37006), but you could. And that damage might be the difference between defeating the villain on your next turn - or the villain living one turn longer and you losing the game to a bad pull of Under Fire/Advance/Shadow of the Past etc. There's no prizes for ending the game with lots of charge counters!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Crew**:\r\n<hr>\r\n- [Wiccan](/card/15011) - Your right hand thief. You can use your alter-ego ability or [Global Logistics](/card/27043) to set his response up to deal massive damage! He is the primary target for both [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035), [Mission Training](/card/34016), and [X-Mansion](/card/32049)'s healing.\r\n\r\n- [Longshot](/card/35033) - It's a longshot to the top if you wanna rock 'n roll - at least, so he claims. Through arranging star icons through your alter-ego ability or [Global Logistics](/card/27043), Longshot can pick off any pesky security minions with ease. He also loves [X-Mansion](/card/32049)'s healing!\r\n\r\n- [Dazzler](/card/37012) - Too much heat? You need a distraction! Call on Dazzler to confound and confuse your enemy! She's also a great target for [Mission Training](/card/34016) if [Wiccan](/card/15011) is on the run.\r\n\r\n- [Quake](/card/08012) - When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. Not only can [Quake](/card/08012) pick off targets when you're alter-ego, she's well-connected and can always arrange some [Global Logistics](/card/27043).\r\n\r\n- [Monica Chang](/card/27040) - Master of the stakeout, Monica manages your [Surveillance Team](/card/01064)s. Not only do your [Surveillance Team](/card/01064)s help your [Global Logistics](/card/27043), but they have close ties with [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) and work alongside them pilfer cards.\r\n\r\n- [Rogue](/card/37002) - If you've ever played a fantasy game or rolled dice in D&D, you already know a rogue is a thief - and some things never change. Rogue is your all-purpose scoundrel who, thanks to your street smarts ([Mutant Education](/card/37021), is always there when you need her. Try to maintain 3-4 Charge counters at all times while she's in your deck! Playing her for 0-cost is a real steal.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Underworld Connections:**\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[Global Logistics](/card/27043) is the star of the show. So let's talk about it in detail:\r\n\r\n[Quake](/card/08012), [Monica Chang](/card/27040), and 2x [Surveillance Team](/card/01064) are each a great target to exhaust for [Global Logistics](/card/27043), and - in a pinch - [Helicarrier](/card/01092). When possible, try to keep one out at all times. If you don't need to block with [Quake](/card/08012)? Don't. If you aren't desperate for the last charge of a [Surveillance Team](/card/01064)? Then keep it!\r\n\r\nGetting and keeping out a cheap SHIELD card is key to bringing [Global Logistics](/card/27043) online, and [Global Logistics](/card/27043) is key to getting the most out of your allies.\r\n\r\nAside from the combos with allies, you can also often choose your boost and encounter cards in solo play, and boost cards in multiplayer.\r\n\r\nIn an average [Global Logistics](/card/27043) turn, you will usually only use one or two of the encounter cards you arrange with your allies - there is not always a minion out for [Longshot](/card/35033), and either him or [Wiccan](/card/15011) might not be in play. And you generally won't want to use your alter-ego ability every turn.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 2-3 encounter cards to arrange for the future! For boost cards, aim for low boost icons - if you can set them up to scheme for 0, you can safely go alter-ego. Avoid star icons unless the boost effect won't affect you.\r\n\r\nFor an encounter card, aim for the weakest ones - Quickstrike minions are great if you know you're ending the turn in alter-ego, and side schemes are usually great in solo if you have allies/[Surveillance Team](/card/01064)s out.\r\n\r\nUsing [Global Logistics](/card/27043) to its maximum potential takes some practice, and you have to be aware of whether you will run out of cards in your deck when drawing your hand - or else your carefully constructed order will fall apart! But, with some crafty planning, you can really pull the strings and mastermind perfect turns.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n**Good luck and have fun, mon ami!**\r\n<hr>", "user_id": 16053, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01064": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01092": 1, "04047": 1, "08012": 1, "08013": 2, "15011": 1, "27024": 1, "27040": 1, "27043": 3, "32020": 1, "32049": 1, "33035": 1, "34016": 1, "35033": 1, "36022": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37012": 1, "37021": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "2.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26451, "name": "Med Lab party at Steve's apartment!", "date_creation": "2023-02-27T14:55:36+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-14T18:30:33+00:00", "description_md": "# There's a party at Cap's place, and all the Avengers are invited!\r\n\r\n![Captain America Dancing](https://imgur.com/QflT7F3.gif)\r\n\r\nYou hear a lot of good things about Captain America, great stat line, easy way to re-ready, good hero events. But did you know the Steve Roger Alter-ego is *also awesome*?\r\n\r\nThis deck focuses on taking advantage of the new [Med Lab](/card/38028) support from Rogue's pack in combination with Steve's ability to play allies in alter-ego at a discount, combo'd with [Avengers Tower](/card/03024)\r\n\r\n## Party planning\r\n\r\nWhere is the party? at [Steve's Apartment](/card/03007). You're gonna want this down for that extra card plus free healing every alter ego turn. Generally I won't start flipping every turn until this support is down.\r\n\r\nIt's an Avengers deck, so [Mighty Avengers](/card/21015) is important to get down early. This makes playing the signature [Agent 13](/card/03002) a little awkward, as she takes away the team bonus. If she does show up to the party, let the villain take her out quickly so the party can get started again.\r\n\r\n[Avengers Tower](/card/03024) and [The Triskelion](/card/01073) bump your ally limit up to 5 (6 counting [Stinger](/card/12014)), and get you a discount on Avengers coming in.\r\n\r\n[Command Team](/card/23016) is there to give your allies extra swings when they are buffed up, and [Honorary Avenger](/card/03025) is there to put on Steve so you don't lose the team bonus when flipping.\r\n\r\n[Med Lab](/card/38028) is where things get interesting. If a guest parties too hard and knocks themself out with consequential damage, Med Lab is there to keep them available to come back in. You can only reclaim the ally in alter-ego, but for Steve that's a good thing! Alter ego allies are cheaper. Steve's ability does target the first ally played in a *round*, however. So in multiplayer, have the first player request the [Avengers Tower](/card/03024) action first thing, so you can get that bonus!\r\n\r\nPriority order for setup is:\r\n* [Super-Soldier Serum](/card/03010)/[Captain America's Shield](/card/03009) so you can afford to set up and survive\r\n* [Steve's Apartment](/card/03007)\r\n* [Avengers Tower](/card/03024)\r\n* [Med Lab](/card/38028)\r\n* [The Triskelion](/card/01073)/[Command Team](/card/23016)\r\n\r\n## The guest list\r\n\r\nWe want guests that are on theme (Avengers), but we also want guests who can take advantage of the [Med Lab](/card/38028). For this reason, every ally included is able to knock themselves out with consequential damage with 2 basic actions. There are a few categories here:\r\n\r\n### The exciting entrance\r\n\r\n[Black Panther](/card/23012), [Kaluu](/card/21014), [Squirrel Girl](/card/03013), and [White Tiger](/card/04099) have good effects then they enter play. They are useful to have in the med lab to repeat these abilities more often. [Black Panther](/card/23012) in particular is excellent under med lab. He will cost only 2 Effective resources from under med lab in alter ego with avengers tower, and he can grab a combo piece if you need it. If not, he can grab [Get Ready](/card/01069), ready himself and start swinging the same turn he comes out of med lab\r\n\r\n### The life of the party\r\n\r\nLike any Avengers deck, the goal is to have a turn where you buff your allies like crazy, and have them activate multiple times. [Goliath](/card/04013) and [Power Man](/card/21012) are your heavy hitters. Fully buffed, Goliath can do 9 damage per swing, and power man can do 8. They are also useful while setting up for taking out a beefy minion\r\n\r\n\r\n### seat fillers\r\n\r\n[Stinger](/card/12014) and [Ant-Man](/card/12011) are CHEAP. They are here to provide bodies for [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017), and do a little emergency thwarting or damage if necessary\r\n\r\n## The grand finale\r\n\r\nThis party is here to set up a big turn. Ideally, you have 6 avengers on the table (7 counting cap), you play [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) to draw 6 cards, [Avengers Assemble!](/card/03015) to re-ready everybody, and then as many [Lead from the Front](/card/01070)s as you have available. Then swing as many times as possible with [Get Ready](/card/01069), [Command Team](/card/23016), and cap's own I can do this All Day ability. This should be more than enough damage to take out a full phase of a villain in 1 or 2 player.\r\n\r\n## The hangover\r\n\r\nIf the combo turn isn't enough to finish the game, it's not too hard to set it up again by rebuilding your allies. [Med Lab](/card/38028) makes it easy to get the important allies back out again after they do their job.\r\n\r\nThis deck has done pretty well in both solo and multiplayer in Expert mode. Here are some possible substitutions you might use to fit your play style:\r\n\r\n* [Quincarrier](/card/08023) can be useful if you find yourself running out of resources. You can use it to save cards in hand to use with I can do this All Day or [Shield Toss](/card/03006)\r\n* [Blade](/card/21019). He's a cheap avenger! He can't go under med team though, because he doesn't deal consequential damage. Could be useful just for muscle though\r\n* [Team-Building Exercise](/card/12024) is like another avengers tower, ~~although you can't play them both on the same ally~~, edit: you can play TBE and avengers tower together actually, but the issue is the TBE action is in conflict with the med lab action.\r\n* [Hawkeye](/card/04011) can self-KO in 2 and is cheap, if you need another space-filler ally.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to [@journeyman2](https://marvelcdb.com/user/profile/8938/journeyman2) for helping to workshop and test the deck!\r\n\r\nLet me know what tough scenarios you take down with this deck, or any cool tweaks you come up with!

Well\u2026she can\u2019t\u2026except in Marvel Champions! With 10 readies, 3 cards to recur said readies, and plenty of sustain, we\u2019ll show the naysayers Rogue has a real (re)purpose among the cast.\r\n\r\nThis is a repurpose always ready deck focused on the ally side of touched, utilizing Rogue\u2019s unique trait taking ability to deal massive damage. Set up your board, borrow your allies traits, and go crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRogue has some great readies in her kit\u2026and even better, she\u2019s unique in she can recur readies.\r\n\r\n[Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) has a ready to target regardless of the ally you have out. Having [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) in hand means whatever ready you just used can be a target if the ally aspect matches, or just guaranteeing 2 readies that turn plus your basic. \r\n\r\nChoosing who to give [Touched](/card/38002) can offer an interesting puzzle. [Dauntless](/card/16016) can help make the decision easier if you are able to stay healthy, however I would rate it as the lowest priority upgrade in the deck. Typically, it will be more beneficial in the early game to put Touched on the villain and get some status effects going to give you the needed breathing room to set up, as well as preventing the need to chump block. Once you are ready, you'll be utilizing your allies to set up OTK's with your Quicksilver levels of readying. So far, I have been able to get off 4 readies in a turn, resulting in 28 damage. \r\n\r\nFor those curious on the math that turn started out with 2 tech pieces out, [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) and [Victor Mancha](/card/26015). Attach [Touched](/card/38002) to Vic, basic attack (2) use the one [Repurpose](/card/31016) in hand (+4) recur it with [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) to toss another tech (+6), [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) to the villain (+9 thanks to the 2 damage from the transfer +7 now that the Jacket is adding an extra ATK), and a [Reboot](/card/26024) for good measure (+7).Not too shabby.\r\n\r\nRandom note:\r\n\r\nRogue is only Aerial while having touched on an ally, so make sure you use [Ever Vigilant](/card/17030) before [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) onto a villain. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cNo [What Doesn't Kill Me](/card/27016)??\u201d\r\n\r\n[Reboot](/card/26024) is a cheaper and more flexible version of the card, not requiring you need to heal is huge, especially since Rogue does a great job with her own sustain. She also has her issues of not generating resources in kit so you\u2019re relying on the draw to play it any way. However, for those that prefer it, [Enhanced Physique](/card/06034) helps secure the required resource as the rest of the deck is varied in resources. I would definitely sub out [Ever Vigilant](/card/17030)for it if that\u2019s the route you want to take.\r\n\r\n\"No [Forcefield Generator](/card/31019)?!?!\"\r\n\r\nRogue's biggest issue is her expensive suite of cards. In my playtesting it's just too expensive. This deck tries to stay under 3 cost as much as possible, allowing Rogue to either set up or do multiple actions in a turn. Also, in my testing, one of the biggest hurdles is an untimely Toughness spoiling the fun, and [Plasma Pistol](/card/20022) helps shore that up while being a prime [Repurpose](/card/31016) target.\r\n\r\n\"No [The Sorcerer Supreme](/card/09026), [\"Go for Champions!\"](/card/29025) or [Web of Life and Destiny](/card/27023)?!\"\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s awesome she can use cards like these, but android Allies are the priority for this build.

Phoenix seemed like the most natural choice to me; you get easy access to [Cerebro](/card/34022), ensuring a consistent stream of allies and a way to search for [Pixie](/card/36017), who is completely insane with Med-Lab. And as a bonus, you also have [Psychic Kicker](/card/34034) which helps activate your allies to death much faster than other heroes can. If that's not fast enough you can also ready them with [Utopia](/card/33020)!\r\n\r\nThe ally suite is about what you'd expect from a Leadership X-Men deck; we don't really have that many options and I normally wouldn't bother with [Gentle](/card/36016) since he's just a worse version of [Colossus](/card/35021) but the option of giving him double consequential damage on his attacks is actually a benefit in this deck if you want something to go under your Med-Lab. And we'd really like to have as many targets as possible for Cerebro to find. But mostly you're spamming Pixie and using her to recur all your other allies. Recur [Forge](/card/36022) to get out all your support cards, recur [Professor X](/card/32019) for confuses to compensate for all the flipping you're doing, Colossus, Gentle and [Beast](/card/33011) for efficient beatsticks.\r\n\r\nThe important cards to mulligan for: Cerebro, [Forge](/card/36022) (to search Cerebro), [Uncanny X-Men](/card/36018). Uncanny deserves special mention here: once you have it out it is not difficult for this deck to play three allies in one turn (Pixie, whatever you get from your discard pile with her effect, and whatever you get from your deck with Cerebro). Honestly I would heavily consider running a third copy just to guarantee that we get it as early as possible, but this is a Phoenix deck and she has enough dead cards already. We also have a copy of [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) to put on Phoenix so she still has the trait when she flips down to Alter-Ego, letting you have the discount from Uncanny at all times. Med-Lab is obviously what the deck is built around but you'd rather play it mid-game after you've set up your other pieces, and since you have two copies you can let the first one go if you have something more important to do first. [Jet](/card/32020), [Utopia](/card/33020), and [Team-Building Exercise](/card/12024) are nice to find early as well.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, you know the drill, it's the usual X-Men ally craziness. Slam allies every turn, trigger Utopia a bunch, win. You probably won't use that many Phoenix cards, and it barely matters whether you decide to unleash, but having 3 THW is a great way to keep things stable while you set up your big combos. And between [Rise from the Ashes](/card/34006), [Telekinetic Shield](/card/34007) and [White Hot Room](/card/34004) Phoenix can be surprisingly durable, which helps for those early turns where you don't want to chump. I'm sure there are more powerful heroes who can take better advantage of Med-Team, but I've found Phoenix to be a very underrated hero, especially when used as a platform for powerful aspect and trait synergies.

So, with the release of [Med Lab](/card/38028), I wanted to play War Machine and use the Lab to keep Iron Man available as much as possible. So, that's the goal of this deck.\r\n\r\nI mulligan real hard for Iron Man or [Call for Aid](/card/12015), which is basically copies 2 and 3 of Iron Man. He will start fetching your **Tech** upgrades so you can set up Rhodey's suit. You have [Command Team](/card/23016), [Get Ready](/card/01069), and of course, the big money [Two Against the World](/card/23024) so you can ready Iron Man and get him under the Med Lab. Two Against the World can really shine here, since Iron Man will come back into play from Med Lab exhausted and you can get 2 **Tech** into play. If you're all set up with War Machine's **Tech**, then you have [Reinforced Suit](/card/12018) and [Powered Gauntlets](/card/01038) for him to grab, giving you a neat little Voltron ally.\r\n\r\nIron Man (and the other allies, all SHIELD, so as to not interfere with Call for Aid), really shore up Rhodey's weak thwarting abilities. With [Leadership Skill](/card/36019) you can get any of the allies up to 3 THW, which is very strong, and since it doesn't exhaust, it works great in a round where you have a ready for Iron Man.\r\n\r\nThe other allies are just window dressing. Sometimes in the period between Iron Man being under Med Lab (until he dies by consequential), Maria is an amazing ally to have in the Lab. Agent 13 can ready [Munitions Bunker](/card/23003), Command Team, and [Helicarrier](/card/01092). Most games, I stockpile at least 10 ammo on the Bunker before using it in hero to rush the villain.\r\n\r\nVideos of the deck:\r\n\r\n- [Tower Defense](https://youtu.be/MaVnQA6ID0A)\r\n- [Venom Goblin](https://youtu.be/3HsvrlVkdkI)", "user_id": 1903, "investigator_code": "23001a", "investigator_name": "War Machine", "slots": {"01067": 1, "01069": 3, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "01092": 1, "08023": 1, "12015": 2, "12017": 1, "12018": 1, "13024": 2, "21058": 1, "23002": 1, "23003": 1, "23004": 1, "23005": 2, "23006": 1, "23007": 1, "23008": 2, "23009": 2, "23010": 2, "23011": 2, "23016": 2, "23024": 1, "27046": 1, "36019": 2, "38028": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26483, "name": "Rogue", "date_creation": "2023-02-28T14:16:40+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-28T14:16:40+00:00", "description_md": "Go For Champions!\r\n\r\nThis deck focuses on Rogue, touching a Basic Champion then using super power absorption to bring back \"Go for Champions\" and defend for the table multiple times with her and the Champions.\r\n\r\nChampions mobile bunker is helpful because it cycles her deck and helps her to have better options.\r\n\r\nPlenty of resource cards to help her build up fast.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "user_id": 10669, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01079": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "05012": 1, "05015": 2, "13018": 1, "13019": 1, "13024": 2, "16024": 1, "17030": 2, "28020": 1, "29023": 1, "29024": 1, "29025": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32049": 1, "37019": 1, "37021": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "2.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26484, "name": "Good Stuff", "date_creation": "2023-02-28T14:34:47+00:00", "date_update": "2023-02-28T17:01:26+00:00", "description_md": "Versi\u00f3n de Wild Tutor actualizada, prescindiendo del pack stun confuse lock, para evitar villanos con firmeza o tes\u00f3n, para a\u00f1adir el pack good stuff (respuestas para todo).\r\n\r\nHablaremos de los cambios respecto a su versi\u00f3n original.\r\nAliados:\r\nAgente Coulson y una planificaci\u00f3n de cada aspecto, que nos dar\u00e1  lo que necesitemos en ese momento, adem\u00e1s de proporcionarnos variedad para la capacidad propia de warlock (magia de combate).\r\nThor para defendernos con su duro y barrer mesa s\u00ed se acumulan los esbirros.\r\n\r\nEventos:\r\nDe un modo u otro para robar cartas.\r\nDesv\u00edo para defendernos y seguir con la sinergia de vaciar el mazo.\r\nEntrar en combate para quitarnos esbirro y un poco de planificaci\u00f3n a la vez, muchas veces necesitas hacerlo con una sola carta.\r\nHacer la llamada para cualquier aliado que tenga habilidad de entrar en juego.\r\n\r\nMejora:\r\nAguante porque es un mazo que a veces le cuesta arrancar y puede sufrir bastante da\u00f1o hasta que se hace con el control de la partida.

From the Ultimates timeline a clone of Peter Parker, Jessica Drew (confused yet?), occasionally operates under the code name. Is this Natasha? Not at all, but that's why it's a technicality. And with this deck focusing on Black Widow's gear, a TECHnicality!\r\n\r\nTo actually talk about the deck, we're using the new Leadership card Med Lab. There's been community discussion on how Spider-Man Otto Octavius could be a decent target for this card, but I ultimately wasn't very satisfied with this in most cases. Considering Med Lab puts ally's into play as an Alter-Ego Action, the amount of upgrades we could use, ready with Otto, and use again is actually pretty small. But there are some that fit this bill, and Black Widow's Gauntlets will do just fine!\r\n\r\nSo either through playing Web of Life and Destiny or using Make the Call to get another Web-Warrior trait into play we'll be able to play Otto from are Med Lab. The loop is simple and goes:\r\n\r\n1. Use a Gauntlet\r\n\r\n2. Play Otto from Medlab to ready a Gauntlet to use again and draw a card. \r\n\r\n3. We then go to Hero Form, and next turn (when Otto and Med Lab are no longer exhausted) we use Otto's basic attack to have him defeated by consequential damage and placed into Med Lab. \r\n\r\n4. Go back to Alter-Ego and get ready to do it all again once Med Lab is ready.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're also going to draw a card from Web of Life when Otto is placed onto Med Lab (if this ruling changes, this combo still works, just one less resource). So in total after setup we'll profit 2 card draws and a extra resource for a Preparation card every time we do the loop, with an extra two damage from Otto's attack, which more than compensates the resources we're putting in to play Otto every other turn. Black Widow also has some of the best ways to make sure Alter-Ego is always an option with two copies of Covert Ops, so she's naturally good at utilizing Med Lab.\r\n\r\nYou will find yourself flooded in value with this combo combined with looping SP/dr and other Web of Life draws. Add in effective generic resource generators, and Black Widow's own superb economy. You'll be at the point of overwhelming the Villain before you'll need to setup all of this, but you do have so many options to that you'll achieve this win-con early and consistently without needing to fear painful disruption. Plus, Otto and Medlab are cards that Black Widow would like to run anyway(Med Lab Winter Soldier is good if the game is stretches on that long), so you're not out anything by having this combo available.\r\n\r\nFor our break down, Ghost-Spider is a high value web Warrior that can grab our effective events. Maria Hill is more cycling to see combo sooner, same with Nick Fury, but he also likes coming in with a Rapid Response. Professor X is another confuse for how much we're flipping down and can be played on demand with Make the Call. SP/dr and Otto are the high value Web Warriors that will spend the game spinning Webs of value. Stinger also is another body we can squeeze on board which can fill up very quickly, but we appreciate having something that's always playable to spend resources on.\r\n\r\nMake the Call lets us dodge the Web-Warrior trait and keep our options open (after some setup it's a welcome out for converting resources to board presence). Power in All of Us helps us setup up Web-Warrior cards, high value support like Avengers Mansion and Quincarrier, and makes threading in Nick Fury or Professor X much easier. Clarity is another simple resource generator that makes putting in other expensive cards even quicker and just thins the deck as well. Rapid Response is a high value prep to spend the refreshed gauntlets easier and has many good targets. Target Acquired is always one of my favorite 40th cards, but being a prep itself is good plus it's boost cancellation can also help with corner case effects that might remove our spinning allies, being re-curable with Safe House if we know of multiple such affects is a nice bonus.\r\n\r\nWeb-Warrior Leadership is tried and true, but having a new niche combo enabled by a recent release felt worth sharing.

This means you'll be in Alter-Ego form for a few rounds as [Tony Stark](/card/01029b), using his Futurist ability to dig three cards deep and adding one of those cards to your hand, discarding the other two. Being in Alter-Ego form means the villain will be scheming quite a bit meaning the main scheme threat will be high in a couple rounds. And once you have fully built at least six pieces of Iron Man's Mark V suit, you will hardly go back into Alter-Ego form.\r\n\r\nSo with these two ideas in mind, I worry about thwarting with Iron Man as fast as possible changing into Hero form, and healing damage as I stay in Hero form (Iron Man is not great at defending). Therefore, I decided to go with the Protection aspect focusing on the healing factor with [Med Team](/card/01080). [Black Widow](/card/01075) and [Get Behind Me!](/card/01078) are primarily used for resource generation (along with [The Power of Protection](/card/01079)) and can be used to disrupt the more detrimental Villain Treachery cards. In the Core Set, I only use nine Protection cards, and will evolving the deck over time in a progressive manner with additional Hero Packs.\r\n\r\nTo fill out the Basics, the idea is limiting threat in Alter-Ego form and healing damage in Hero form. So I maximized on [Emergency](/card/01085) and [First Aid](/card/01086). I also maximize on [Haymaker](/card/01087) since it can provided medium damage and <span class=\"icon-energy\"></span> symbols for [Repulsor Blast](/card/01031). The rest of the Basic cards being the typical [Nick Fury](/card/01084), [Mockingbird](/card/01083), [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091), and [Helicarrier](/card/01092).\r\n\r\nThe first phase of your play should focus on building Iron Man's Mark V Suit: [Mark V Armor](/card/01036), [Mark V Helmet](/card/01037), [Rocket Boots](/card/01039), [Powered Gauntlets](/card/01038), and [Arc Reactor](/card/01035). Make sure to maximize the use of [Pepper Potts](/card/01033) and [Stark Tower](/card/01034) while you are building your suit. The next phase should be mitigating and reducing threat off of schemes and cleaning up weaker minions; while chipping away at the Villain's health. Keep in mind to heal your HP while you reach the last phase of the game, finishing off the Villain with your power moves, [Repulsor Blast](/card/01031) and [Supersonic Punch](/card/01032).\r\n\r\nA tip during situations with multiple weak minions on the field is to use [War Machine](/card/01030) to spread damage and using Powered Gauntlets to focus on individual minions. You can use Med Team to heal War Machine to continue to use his ability. In no minion situations, War Machine is better to just activate his Attack for 2 damage twice before having to Med Team up to full health.\r\n\r\nI am using this as the base build while I progress further into the game as I introduce new Hero packs to the game which will open up different strategies with new cards. So far, with the Core Set alone, I have defeated both Rhino (standard) and Klaw (standard).

Don't worry, it's part of what makes being a stay-at-home X-Man work.\r\nI'll take you through the different Support facilities we have access to here at the school before explaining how I spend my Event time and introducing you to the different members of the X-Men. Finally, I'll teach you about some of the notable things I've learned from my time as [Field Commander](/card/33004)\r\n\r\n<h3>Support</h3>\r\nTo start, [Cerebro](/card/34022) is one of our most valuable assets, allowing me to find the X-Man I need, especially if one of our Psionic members with me. More on them later.  Should you ever doubt on what you need to lead the X-Men from home, the answer is going to be [Cerebro](/card/34022).\r\n\r\nNext we have the [Danger Room](/card/33021). After some [Danger Room Training](/card/33015), any member of the X-Men is a force to be reckoned with, making this our second most important asset.\r\n\r\nThe new [Med Lab](/card/38028) is a very useful tool to get our injured members back out there. Just remember that not everyone has need of it and [Pixie](/card/36017) seems to really enjoy hanging out there.\r\n\r\nDon't mind [The Triskelion](/card/01073) parked behind the school. I'm sure S.H.I.E.L.D. knows where it is. I just need to ship more X-Men out to deal with the villain, but I think Nick Fury prefers use to keep it where it is. Where's [The X-Jet](/card/32020)? Well, Rogue and Gambit are taking the Blackbird on a joyride so we can't use it to have more X-Men in the field.\r\n\r\nThe island of [Utopia](/card/33020) is valuable location and I prefer to pay it a visit after making use of [Cerebro](/card/34022) and the [Danger Room](/card/33021)\r\n\r\nStaying at the [X-Mansion](/card/32049) is not mandatory, but it does significantly improve our [Mutant Education](/card/37021 program), but we'll come back to that.\r\n\r\n[Team Training](/card/04016) is great for any team, but doesn't take priority over anything most of the time. It can definitely be useful at times though.\r\n\r\n<h3>Event</h3>\r\nNow you might ask 'Mr Summers, what do you do all day while the members of your team are out there busting their asses?'. I'll be straight forward with you. For the majority, I'm spending my time on [Meditation](/card/26036) and determining our [Priority Target](/card/33007)s when necessary. It helps me figure out who to deploy and do so more efficiently than I can when I'm out on the field myself.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, there's [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) and I enjoy using this when the first X-Men are deployed to the field to accelerate ourselves towards victory. Especially if it enables us to access [Cerebro](/card/34022) or the [Danger Room](/card/33021).\r\n\r\nAfter trying out several tactics and throwing them away at whoever of the X-Men needs them, figuring out who your [Priority Target](/card/33007)s are through some [Mutant Education](/card/37021) is the way to go for me. Especially if I'm at the [X-Mansion](/card/32049), which makes it so that I not only can deploy tactics anew, but we'll gain something as well!\r\n\r\n<h3>Upgrade</h3>\r\n[Danger Room Training](/card/33015), as mentioned before, makes any of the X-Men a force to be reckoned with. Just remember to grab a fresh training regimen in the [Danger Room](/card/33021) before resorting to old ones as it helps speed everything up.\r\n\r\nFinally, through sheer [Leadership Skill](/card/36019), I make sure that not only my team is more effective, but also prevent myself from getting [Caught Off Guard](/card/01188) and losing my [Cerebro](/card/34022) and [Danger Room](/card/33021) privileges.\r\n\r\n<h3>Ally</h3>\r\n<h4>Psionics</h4>\r\nOur psionic mutant friends are key to fully utilizing [Cerebro](/card/34022) while we sit around at the school. \r\n\r\nJean, better known as [Phoenix](/card/33002) is one of the best and will make sure I get that [Priority Target](/card/33007) right again. \r\n[Psylocke](/card/35013) on the other hand allows me to lounge in my underwear as her origin story confuses the villain.\r\n[Professor X](/card/32019) does the same, but he always wanders off somewhere else, so I make sure to tell him to use [Cerebro](/card/34022) before he goes to visit [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018) or Magneto.\r\n[Blindfold](/card/33014), [Marvel Girl](/card/34015) and [Mirage](/card/36015) are also great for helping me use [Cerebro](/card/34022), but I prefer to resort to the others when the opportunity strikes.\r\n\r\n<h4>Staff</h4>\r\nI have to admit, technology can be fickle here at the Xavier Institute, but [Forge](/card/36022) can help you out no matter what. Just remember that a working [Cerebro](/card/34022) and [Danger Room](/card/33021) is our top concern. Getting to [Utopia](/card/33020) or having the disco lights in the [X-Mansion](/card/32049) are secondary.\r\n\r\n[Pixie](/card/36017) will help convince other X-Men to go on a mission again. She doesn't really need [Danger Room Training](/card/33015), mostly because she enjoys staying in the [Med Lab](/card/38028) so much, but otherwise some [Danger Room Training](/card/33015) is better than none.\r\n\r\nI don't know where [Beast](/card/33011) keeps finding the [Strength](/card/01090), [Genius](/card/01089) and sheer [Energy](/card/01088) to convince other X-Men to head out with him, but he does so I make sure to deploy him before anyone else when I find him with [Cerebro](/card/34022).\r\n\r\n<h4>Others</h4>\r\nThe rest of the X-men I like to deploy are all reliable while I'm staying back at the school and need very little from me to work.\r\nThere are a few members I'd like to specifically highlight.\r\n\r\n[Dazzler](/card/37012) allows me to lounge another day, which is always appreciated. Should [Psylocke](/card/35013) be out of commission, [Dazzler](/card/37012) is the one to go for.\r\n\r\nI hate to admit it, but [Wolverine](/card/32041) is there best there is at what he does, especially after a round of [Danger Room Training](/card/33015) and [Team Training](/card/04016). In his own words, he can 'snikt some bubs for days'.\r\n\r\n[Polaris](/card/32012) helps the team, but depending on what villain we're facing she can be swapped out for someone like [Dust](/card/33012) or [Nightcrawler](/card/32011). This is a case by case situation, but [Polaris](/card/32012) is the most generally useful out of all the options.\r\n\r\n<h3>General advice</h3>\r\nNow, you might wonder, 'Mr Summers, do you truly never take to the field yourself?' The truth is I do, but only after I'm done with my [Meditation](/card/26036) and using all the different facilities at our disposal. Once that's out of the way, I don't mind showing my [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010) every once in a while and make sure we get another [Priority Target](/card/33007).\r\n\r\nStaying at home becomes a lot easier if I'm partnering up with someone to take down the villain, allowing me to stay in my pajamas almost indefinitely while handing out tactics to the X-Men. \r\nShould I be by myself, however, I have to admit that, depending on which villain we're facing, I need a healthy work-life balance and, unfortunately, sometimes take to the field myself. I just make sure that I always make time for my [Meditation](/card/26036) and the activities at the various school facilities.\r\n\r\nI don't intend to use my [Ruby Quartz Visor](/card/33003) much, so in case of a [Lost Visor](/card/33027), I don't fret. When I don't have a need for some [Meditation](/card/26036), I can go find it whenever I want to. Just don't ask me how I'm able find it without being able to see things.\r\n\r\nI'm not afraid to let one of the team members withdraw from the battle and use their old [Danger Room Training](/card/33015) regime to put a different X-Men through the [Danger Room](/card/33021) and deploy them to the field.\r\n\r\nIf I can, I let [Phoenix](/card/33002) stay at the [X-Mansion](/card/32049) to keep her on the mission and enable full function of [Cerebro](/card/34022) at all times and use [Utopia](/card/33020) for the other X-Men. I can also choose to let [Wolverine](/card/32041) stay at the mansion, but he doesn't operate [Cerebro](/card/34022) quite like Jean can.\r\n\r\nThank you for coming to my X-Talk.\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Notes</h3>\r\nI hope you enjoyed my write-up of this deck. \r\nIt's a lot of fun to play and have almost all the X-Men make an appearance.

So instead we bank on seeing every card in the deck one hand at a time and giving her the best chance at brewing a mean pot of coffee. It all starts with...\r\n\r\n### The Ingredients\r\n\r\nWe got Half Guardians and Half X-Men. I love the Guardian allies for Rogue, they are at a great cost value, have good to great abilities, and [Energy Spear](/card/22032) is awesome. [Angela](/card/18011) is an exceptional value and can help setup a same turn [Throg](/card/25014). The real star of the show is [Bug](/card/16040). I love me some BUG!!! However, I also had a good idea I wanted to explore with [Game Time](/card/33022) and that made it so relying just on getting a Guardians to then [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) and then [Attack Training](/card/32043) to unreliable and I said from the outset here I was aiming to add reliability. So enter the X Men! [Forge](/card/36022) has two excellent targets, [Professor X](/card/32019) has great thwart and enter play effect, [Sunfire](/card/35014) provides a solution to a resource starved hero when needed, [Angel](/card/33019) has a great stat line and a great cost. The X Men also make it easier to hit [Game Time](/card/33022) and combined with [Danger Room](/card/33021) they can really set you up early or late in the game which brings me to \r\n\r\n### The Mulligan\r\n\r\nRogue has great events, but if you draw nothing but events or rogue cards (-[Gambit](/card/38003)) in your opening hand trash that entire hand lol. The only event I would hold in the off chance you drew an opening hand of events is [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005), but even then I think I'd risk it. Once you get some allies into play the deck should/hopefully start to roll out and build upon itself as the game goes. Top targets to mulligan for:\r\n\r\n- [Bug](/card/16040)\r\n- [Cosmo](/card/17020)\r\n- [Forge](/card/36022)\r\n- [Professor X](/card/32019) to possible stay in AE turn 1\r\n- either of the 2 Xmen locations \r\n- [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035)\r\n- if you made it this far...literally any ally lol\r\n- .....oh no this is bad....uhhhh I hope you kept that [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005)\r\n\r\n### You Got the TOUCH!!!\r\n*you got the poweeeeeeeer!!! yeah*\r\n\r\nOh you noticed that single copy of [Assess the Situation](/card/12033) and [\"Bring It!\"](/card/19030) have you? Well those are targets for [Touched](/card/38002). In fact there are 3 targets for Touched, with [Game Time](/card/33022) being the primary target. However, Game Time isn't always an active card so Bring it and Assess the Situation are there as an out for those turns you have an extra card and [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) in hand. Even on their own both [Assess the Situation](/card/12033) and [\"Bring It!\"](/card/19030) offer some much needed deck cycling to a hero that as I mentioned before has none. It's an especially neat option when you want to flip down anyways. Surprisingly this is the most use I have gotten out of [Touched](/card/38002) other than attaching it to the Villain.\r\n\r\n### The End \r\n\r\nI have had a lot of fun playing this deck and I hope you have a good time as well. Curious if this works well for anyone else. If you find yourself beating your head against the wall searching your deck for that specific combo with Rogue, I suggest giving this a try because I really think I tried my best to limit that feeling and you can ultimately play the deck as it comes to you.\r\n\r\n*PS I prioritized [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005) over [Southern Cross](/card/38006) when given the option.

There's no shame in hiding behind [Blindfold](/card/33014) or [Professor X](/card/32019), is there...?**\r\n\r\n**...Nah!** \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis deck is built around making the most of the [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) card to defend for you alongside [Hangar Bay](/card/36035).\r\n\r\n[Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) costs 1, and using it means losing it and an ally from your hand. Overall, it's 3 \"effective resources\" spent when played. If you had 5 cards when you started (and no resource generators), you would end up with 2.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that, when playing [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017), we want to aim for at least the same value as we could get from playing a 2-cost card. In this case, it means we want some amazing effects from the allies when they enter play - or allies that will actually survive taking the villain attack!\r\n\r\nFortunately, almost all the allies in this deck provide _great_ value through using [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) on the villain's attack. And those who don't, namely [Pixie](/card/36017), provide great value elsewhere.\r\n\r\n(_Note that, in 3-4 player, you should swap a copy of [Assess the Situation](/card/12033) for an [Armored Vest](/card/01081)._)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#### **The Basics:**\r\n<hr>\r\nAt the start of the game, your mulligan targets are at least one of the following: [The X-Jet](/card/32020), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), [Hangar Bay](/card/36035) and [Utopia](/card/33020). [The X-Jet](/card/32020) is your main target; using its resource to pay for [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) leaves more cards in your hand, which means more flexibility in what you later play in reaction to your encounter cards.\r\n\r\nYour alter-ego action, on Turn 1, should primarily be used to either grab [Pinned Down](/card/11024) to spend as a resource or [Plan B](/card/27024) to set up some reliable damage and excess-tactic disposal! Plan B functions very much like a weaker but cheaper [Element Gun](/card/17007) from Star-Lord.\r\n\r\nWhy do we want to spend [Pinned Down](/card/11024) early on? To get it into our discard pile. Then we can search for it with [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010) whenever we need it. And why would we need it? To set up a 0 ATK minion.\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Cheating the System:**\r\n<hr>\r\nIf you can attach [Pinned Down](/card/11024) to a 1-2 ATK minion, or [Pinned Down](/card/11024) + [Practiced Defense](/card/33006) (with [Field Commander](/card/33004) in play) on a 3 ATK, minion, what you have is a 0 ATK minion. And 0 ATK minions still attack.\r\n\r\nHaving a 0 ATK minion attacking means you can spend [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) to put an ally in play, defend its pathetic attempts to damage you, and boom! You have an ally in play with full hp for cheap. With [Hangar Bay](/card/36035), you can even ready it for immediate use.\r\n\r\nNow, you can simply add 3x [Pinned Down](/card/11024) to the deck to increase the chance of simply drawing it at the right time, or attempt to use your alter-ego ability to find it at the right time, and both of those are valid strategies. But I have had my best results summoning it when needed from the discard pile.\r\n\r\nWith [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017), you want to stay in hero form as much as possible when so that [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) is playable when you draw it, and you want to free up as much of the deck as you can for great allies!\r\n \r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Tools of the Trade:**\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nYou might be looking at the decklist and thinking \"why the heck has he put 3x [Assess the Situation](/card/12033) in here?!\" and you would be right to wonder. While a good card in general and a handy Tactic for [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010), what [Assess the Situation](/card/12033)'s increased handsize does for us here is give us a better chance of drawing an X-Men ally and a copy of [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) in the same hand.\r\n\r\nYou could just add more X-Men allies instead, but at the time of writing, these are the only ones that - in my opinion - reliably get you enough value to justify using them with [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) on the villain's attack. And while the [Pinned Down](/card/11024) 0 ATK minion strategy is good, its effectiveness/ease to setup varies based on the scenario.\r\n\r\n[Forge](/card/36022) can be a good addition, but once [The X-Jet](/card/32020) and [Utopia](/card/33020) are in play he loses a ton of value.\r\n\r\nMost of the other upgrades are fairly self-explanatory. [The X-Jet](/card/32020) and [Helicarrier](/card/01092) increase your resource economy. [Hangar Bay](/card/36035) readies up allies that survive to increase their tempo. [Utopia](/card/33020) readies you and increases your ally limit. And [Plan B](/card/27024) gives you a consistent way to find damage and a place to put any excess tactic upgrades when you draw too many at once.\r\n\r\nIn multiplayer especially, [Hangar Bay](/card/36035) and [Utopia](/card/33020) come into their own. If you play this deck at 3-4 player, be sure to add [Armored Vest](/card/01081) and start defending with Cyclops! With one use of [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) on an ally who gets a Tough, you can defend 4 times. (_Defend with Cyclops, defend with an ally through Mutant Protectors, use Utopia to ready Cyclops and Hangar Bay to ready the ally, defend with both again._)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The X-Pendables:**\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nAnd last but definitely not least, we have our expendable X-Men. While they should be played outside of [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) too, I am going to break their value down based on [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) given that it's the focus of this deck.\r\n\r\nThe general consensus among the community is that blocking a villain activation is roughly equivalent to 2 effective resources. And with [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) costing 3 effective resources, we need to find the extra value from the allies' effects!\r\n\r\n- Armor - With Toughess, she is guaranteed to survive an attack giving you two blocks! She is a prime target for [Hangar Bay](/card/36035) and is still great value if you immediately block with her again before using her ATK or THW.\r\n- [Beast](/card/33011) - By grabbing you a double resource card, Beast + [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) means you are almost entirely refunded, taking the total cost down from 3 cards to 1. Just try to make sure you have something to spend the resources on!\r\n- [Blindfold](/card/33014) - While her value varies and sometimes misses, you can use her response to manipulate your upcoming encounter card. And the difference between pulling Shadow of the Past or giving the villain a Tough status card is enormous.\r\n- [Colossus](/card/35021) - Like Armor, but better. You can use [Hangar Bay](/card/36035) to double-block with him too and still get good value - but you will get most value if you first attack and bring him down to 1 hp and block later.\r\n- [Dazzler](/card/37012) - Blocking attacks is good, blocking the villain scheming is even better. By blocking an attack and confusing the villain, you are stopping two attacks and giving yourself safe access to alter-ego!\r\n- [Phoenix](/card/33002) - When Phoenix enters play, she searches for a card. In a way, this is a 1 resource refund on [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) and brings it in line. But in reality, finding a specific card is more valuable! She can find some of your best cards such as [Priority Target](/card/33007), [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010), and [Full Blast](/card/33008)!\r\n- [Pixie](/card/36017) - This is the one ally you DON'T want to play through [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017)! Keep her in hand, play her from hand to trigger her ability, profit. She does nothing for [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) but she's too good not to bring.\r\n- [Polaris](/card/32012) - Like [Colossus](/card/35021), but even better. You can put the Tough status card on her when [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) brings her in against a villain attack to keep her alive, or on yourself when brought in against a 0 ATK minion.\r\n- [Professor X](/card/32019) - Need there be any introduction? He is basically like [Dazzler](/card/37012) with [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) in that he provides a confuse. Just avoid using him against a 0 ATK minion, he'll disappear at the end of the villain phase!\r\n- [Rockslide](/card/33013) - A poor choice at his full cost, but he often provides two blocks with [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) against the villain! Against a 0 ATK minion? He shines. Using his 3 ATK each turn makes him provide 9 damage for the 3 \"effective resources\" that Mutant Protectors took. And the Retaliate is a sweet bonus.\r\n- [Wolverine](/card/32041) - And last but not least, Wolverine. His damage does wonders for this deck in solo play. Against a 2 ATK villain, he has a decent chance to survive when brought in with [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017). If [Practiced Defense](/card/33006) or a 0 ATK minion is involved? He's easy to bring in! Even when damaged down to his last hp, he'll heal back up!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Alternative Cards**:\r\n<hr>\r\n- [Mirage](/card/36015) - When against a 1 SCH villain? Mirage's response works on them, and means she's worth taking.\r\n- [Sunfire](/card/35014) - An amazing ally - but has no synergy with [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017). Great to bring in solo play in an attachment-heavy scenario.\r\n- [Angel](/card/33019) - A good ally. Is he good with [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017)? Not especially. But a 2-cost ally that can deal 4 damage and block? Still good and a great replacement if another ally is unavailable.\r\n- [Forge](/card/36022) - As alluded to earlier, he's another chance to find your [The X-Jet](/card/32020) or [Utopia](/card/33020) sooner. The problem is, after [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017), can you afford them? And after they're in play, he then becomes the worst ally in the deck.\r\n- [Jocasta](/card/26013) - She can hold [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017) which ups its consistency and also gives you another use of it per deck cycle! Unfortunately, she won't trigger [Utopia](/card/33020)'s ready and turns its increased ally limit off. Once Jocasta is in play and one of the longer-lasting allies (such as Wolverine or Polaris), the ally limit is just too tight for my liking.\r\n- [Bait and Switch](/card/15030) - This card gives you another chance to use [Mutant Protectors](/card/32017)!

Even though it is fast to set up though, there are many scenarios that start so quickly that you sometimes need to be able to act from turn 1 (particularly in solo) and I was struggling. So, I took a bit of the idea from a [Justice build by neothechosen](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/19761/iron-man-flip-only-once-1.0), which can stay in alter-ego a bit. \r\n\r\nWith protection the only real way to have more safety staying in alter-ego is via allies. In particular, [Professor X](/card/32019) can buy time with a confuse and  [Black Widow](/card/01075) can help avoid hitting a treachery that lets the villain scheme. Both have a good thwart stat to help clear threat that you start with. The other allies are [Starhawk](/card/16012), who is generally useful and [Brother Voodoo](/card/09012). The latter brings a decent thwart stat and effectively grabs a resource that you can spend on a tech upgrade. [Machine Man](/card/26022) is there as he is cheap and gives you a way to make use of single cards left in your hand.\r\n\r\nThe other key addition is [Meditation](/card/26036), which really helps to set up quickly. It can pay for allies and resource generators like [Pepper Potts](/card/01033) or [Helicarrier](/card/01092). I actually include [Helicarrier](/card/01092) over [Quincarrier](/card/08023) because it can played while in alter-ego.\r\n\r\nI had to take out a few tech upgrades to fit in the other cards, but I think it is worth it. I was finding that I was not able to play all that I drew anyway. You still have 14 tech upgrades - should be plenty!\r\n\r\nSo you want to stay in alter-ego for 2-3 turns at the start if you can while setting up. Try to get out something for a bit of extra resources ([Pepper Potts](/card/01033) is a great card) and at least 3 tech upgrades. By that point you should manage fine in hero form. \r\n\r\nLate game Iron Man's own kit should be able to deal with pretty much everything.

This is the first time an identity has had meaningful use for its exhaust in an AE centered deck! \r\n\r\n- The real power of *Thief Extraordinaire* is setting the top card of the deck every turn!\r\n  - Perfect boost knowledge means always knowing the next turn's incoming threat, usually leaving a low boost on top to guarantee the villain can never advance the main scheme!\r\n  - Using [Mutant Education](/card/37021) to cycle [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) (on top of [Professor X](/card/32019) and [Dazzler](/card/37012)), the villain can be reliably confused every turn. ***Every turn the villain is confused, Thief Extraordinaire is selecting the encounter card for the round!***\r\n  - This perfect knowledge of the top card of the encounter deck at all times means reliably staying in alter-ego for extended periods, and potentially the whole game!\r\n  - What's even better is that *Thief Extraordinaire* has its discard as part of its cost, meaning you still get to do it even while confused!!\r\n  - To put this in perspective, if a 3-boost would have been the villain's scheme boost, and you discard it to remove 3 threat while leaving the villain a 0-boost, **it is as if Gambit has just thwarted 6!** Likewise, if [Advance](/card/01186) was set to be in the encounter spot, but you discard the other card, making it the boost for the round; **that's as good as a confuse!**\r\n- When the villain is confused and minions SCH for a negligible amount, some games, Gambit doesn't even have to deal with minions! Pulling off the heist from right under their noses! **With low SCH minions essentially being free encounter cards, the tempo for setup is huge, letting him keep the lock going indefinitely.** When it is time to win, Gambit has crazy burst damage potential!\r\n- Always being in alter-ego means 6 card hands + extra resources from [Cerebro](/card/34022), [Danger Room](/card/33021), [Weapon X](/card/35022), [Mutant Education](/card/37021), and all of his doubles (he hits doubles more often thanks to [Mutant Education](/card/37021)).\r\n  - This means fast set up and the ability to flood expensive allies w/Training upgrades \r\n\r\nIt almost feels like Gambit is in a different game from the villain since there is very little the villain can do to disrupt this. An alter-ego strategy means:\r\n- More resources per turn\r\n- Never taking attacks->no risk of losing to damage\r\n- Status-lock the villain\r\n- Perfect control over the top of the encounter deck->no risk of losing to threat\r\n- Quickstrike always whiffs (like [Belladonna](/card/37026))\r\n- Can always deal with alter-ego obligations and attachments\r\n- Can play [Weapon X](/card/35022) and [Cerebro](/card/34022) from 6-card hands instead of needing to flip down from a 5-card hand\r\n\r\n*This deck feels like cheating a bit, but it's really just the card up your sleeve!*\r\n\r\n## **Assembling the Crew**\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://imgur.com/v98Qqff.jpeg\">\r\n*Removed profanity since this is a family site, but you know the caption already, right?*\r\n\r\nIn order to guarantee the confuse from [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) or the card draw from [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003), Remy needs ways to tweak threat numbers outside of the unreliable *Thief Extraordinaire*. This will primarily be done with allies and [Mission Training](/card/34016), where permanent/extended alter-ego allows for repeated use of [Danger Room](/card/33021), [Cerebro](/card/34022), and [X-Mansion](/card/32049)\r\n\r\n- **[Professor X](/card/32019)** is the mastermind, in constant contact with the whole crew, getting them ready and in position for additional thwart, damage, or use of *Thief Extraordinaire*!\r\n- **[Dazzler](/card/37012)** is the demolitions expert, setting things off so the crew can infiltrate!\r\n- **[Blindfold](/card/33014)** is the pickpocket, stealing key items from the mark and leading them away from the scene! Stack the deck in Remy's favor, either before or after using *Thief Extraordinaire* to increase the odds of getting what he wants!\r\n- **[Banshee](/card/34014)** is the communications expert, shutting out the guards' comms and leaving them in the dark! Excellent minion tech, I've had games where he confuse-locks a minion parallel to Remy confuse-locking the villain. With [Mission Training](/card/34016) or [X-Mansion](/card/32049), he can do this for the entire game! In one 2-player game with a Voltron deck partner, [Banshee](/card/34014) locked down a [Werewolf Pack](/card/39052) from the Horror show mod and kept it in front of him the entire game so it wouldn't be shuffled back, saving the Voltron ally from any risk of being hit by its effect!\r\n- **[Marvel Girl](/card/34015)** is the conwoman, chipping a minion while putting the main within range for Remy to safecrack!\r\n- **[Storm](/card/34021)** is the getaway driver, laying down some fog cover and pulling the crew out in the [The X-Jet](/card/32020)! Rearranging threat with her ability can really line things up nicely!\r\n- **[Forge](/card/36022)** provides the tech for the heist, setting up bases of operation at the [X-Mansion](/card/32049), [Cerebro](/card/34022), [Danger Room](/card/33021), [Utopia](/card/33020), and providing a getaway vehicle in the [The X-Jet](/card/32020)!\r\n- **[Rogue](/card/37002)** is a beater with an extra health thanks to toughness! In solo, there won't be many attacks to block, so soaking retaliate into her tough to cue something up for another heist crew to clear is a niche positive! After a single flip, she'll be free the rest of the game!\r\n- **[Cerebro](/card/34022)** pulls the crew together!\r\n- The heist plan is run through the **[Danger Room](/card/33021)**, where each crew member receives their **[Mission Training](/card/34016)**! It is almost always best to pull a copy of [Mission Training](/card/34016) from the deck instead of the discard. This thins the deck and guarantees that it is never drawn in place of a more useful card\r\n- The **[X-Mansion](/card/36025)** is the heist crew safehouse, healing one crew member every turn! Alternate between the skillsets with the most utility in terms of stats and ability\r\n- **[Beat Cop](/card/10029)** is our man on the inside. Removing one threat per turn allows for precision control over the heist. We can also order him to plant evidence and apprehend an obstacle in our way, even from alter-ego! [Beat Cop](/card/10029)'s damage works through stunned, ignores retaliate, and is trigger able from alter-ego to clear pesky Patrol minions\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sly/images/5/58/Thievius_Raccoonus_from_Sly_3.png\">\r\n\r\n*The Cooper Gang receives help from Sly's ancestors in the form of techniques recorded in the Thievius Raccoonus, while Remy has his loyal band of mutants!*\r\n\r\n## **The Longshot Gambit**\r\n\r\nUsually, **[Longshot](/card/35033)** is a bit of a gambit. But nothing is ever really a longshot when playing with Gambit!\r\n\r\nUsing *Thief Extraordinaire* or [Blindfold](/card/33014) to put a star boost on the top of the deck guarantees that [Longshot](/card/35033) will defeat a non-elite minion! With a [Mission Training](/card/34016) and some healing from [X-Mansion](/card/32049), [Longshot](/card/35033) can stick around all game, clearing patrolling guards out of the heist crew's path. *(And minions with Patrol can block Remy's alter-ego thwarting, so they need to be cleared!)*\r\n\r\nOf course, [Longshot](/card/35033) won't come out unless Gambit is throwing the cards around in hero form, so at least once there needs to be a hero turn to either play [Longshot](/card/35033) or play [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) to set up a future play. While in hero, may as well *Charge de Card* twice and gain any additional counters from [Natural Agility](/card/37008) and [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010), setting [Rogue](/card/37002) up to be played for free from alter-ego!\r\n\r\n- [Longshot](/card/35033) is the wild card of the heist crew. Sometimes uncertain, but with Remy's guiding hand, they can call the villain's bluff, up the ante, and go all in!\r\n\r\n## **Money Heist**\r\n\r\nThe goal is to steal enough money that we can move to a tropical island and hang up the gig for good!\r\n\r\nOne benefit of staying in alter-ego is always having a 6-card hand size. Having an extra card up the sleeve, really helps to win those games of 5-card draw!\r\n\r\n- **[Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010)** won't place a charge counter when spent, but it is perfectly playable in alter-ego!\r\n- **[Mutant Education](/card/37021)** is not a card I recommend in any deck except Gambit, where it is never dead and even preferred! The key targets are [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010), cycling economy, and [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) for the confuse (remember, there is the option to only shuffle 1 card back in if there is only 1 of these, don't thicken the deck with jokers that won't be useful)\r\n- **[Weapon X](/card/35022)** combos well with [Mutant Education](/card/37021), sometimes immediately drawing a card that was put back in the deck. This is a great use for Remy's health while he camps in alter-ego! [X-Mansion](/card/32049) can always heal it up in a pinch!\r\n- **[Forge](/card/36022)** sets up remarkably fast with all of the double resource recursion and pulling [Cerebro](/card/34022) in alter-ego means it is always playable immediately\r\n- **[Cerebro](/card/34022)** is worth it even trying the odds at the top 5 without a psionic partner. With the amount of deck thinning there is, odds are pretty high! With [Mutant Education](/card/37021) to put [Rogue](/card/37002) back in the deck, [Cerebro](/card/34022) can pull her and play her for free! (Particularly with a Psionic ally out)\r\n- **[The X-Jet](/card/32020)** is a resource that can be used on anything, but in this deck is a lower priority, as value from it is dependent on flipping up and playing [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035)\r\n- **[Utopia](/card/33020)** is great to ready a [Mission Training](/card/34016) ally, stats and activation effects are the name of the game here. But once **[Honorary X-Men](/card/33035)** is on Remy, [Utopia](/card/33020) can allow for double *Thief Extraordinaire* turns! Triple with [Professor X](/card/32019)! This means he can set up [Longshot](/card/35033) *and still* set up the top card for the villain phase!\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://imgur.com/flEfyMz.jpeg\">\r\n*Everyone remembers this scene from Now You See Me right?*\r\n\r\n## **Thieves Guild**\r\n\r\nThis card is so much fun, but when given the option to trigger **[The Thieves Guild](/card/37003)** or [Creole Charmer](/card/37009), the latter is always the correct choice even if it wastes threat. A confuse is worth so much more than a card, even with a higher upfront cost vs [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003). The  extra turn in AE means more resources next turn from larger hand size and AE supports. If the villain is already confused, go right ahead and line up the Guild! Unfortunately, it is very hard to trigger the draw, being almost entirely luck dependent (except on turns where he can *Thief Extraordinaire* multiple times!). At worst, the scheme empties and Guild whiffs, but usually it is just 1 extra threat off a scheme.\r\n\r\n## **Signature Cards**\r\n\r\nWith Remy's time primarily spent in alter-ego, his hero cards will be underplayed. \r\n\r\n- Thin the deck by playing **[Gambit's Staff](/card/37004)** and **[Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005)** with extra resources when possible. Flipping up when the boost is known can guarantee a ready off the armor, and the staff is excellent vs toughs or enemies like [Badoon Assassin](/card/16117) and [Shifting Apparition](/card/27091)\r\n\r\n- **[Royal Flush](/card/37007)** is his signature attack. The endgame of this deck usually is play x2 [Royal Flush](/card/37007) for 18 and attacking with a board of allies and Gambit for another 12-14. Each charge counter spent on [Royal Flush](/card/37007) will boost each instance of damage on it. Just note that his hero interrupt must be used *before* the counter from [Royal Flush](/card/37007) is placed on him, so it cannot be used towards itself\r\n\r\n- **[Natural Agility](/card/37008)** is normally a great card, all but guaranteeing trigger **[Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005)** when you defend for 7+ (I've gone as high as DEF 16). Getting a counter can also make the most out of the few hero turns he needs to win\r\n\r\n## **Mulligan**\r\n\r\nSometimes you just need a do-over on the heist! Here is what we are looking to start out with:\r\n\r\n- **[X-Mansion](/card/32049)** or **[Forge](/card/36022)** are important to get the [Mutant Education](/card/37021) + [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) loop started\r\n\r\n- Any **confuse** is good turn 1\r\n\r\n- Any economy support **[The X-Jet](/card/32020)**, **[Cerebro](/card/34022)**, **[Weapon X](/card/35022)** can help snowball things\r\n\r\n## **Multiplayer**\r\n\r\nIn 2-4p, Remy no longer has perfect knowledge of his boost/encounter card every round. But giving a partner knowledge of their boost can really help **perfect defense** decks or help a partner with the decision to chump, tank, or defend. With constant confuse and boost knowledge, multiple players can safely flip down at once. Higher scheme thresholds of multiplayer are easier to stay down against, but will take more work to set up for [Creole Charmer](/card/37009). I've played this deck at all player counts, usually spending most of the game in alter-ego and still carrying the thwarting and confusing for the team.\r\n\r\nScarlet Witch makes a great partner, since Remy can use *Thief Extraordinaire* out of turn to manipulate the top card of the deck for her, and she can use **[Scarlet Witch's Crest](/card/15009)**  or *Chaos Control* for him!\r\n\r\n## **Other Versions of this Build**\r\n\r\nInitially this started as an \"only AE\" build, but the realization of how good [Longshot](/card/35033) is, made me add him, [The X-Jet](/card/32020), [Utopia](/card/33020), and [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) that previously had been left out. The previous iterations had the following cards:\r\n\r\n- **[Under Surveillance](/card/06031)** was included for awhile, and is useful vs villains with low threshold main scheme 1's, like Ultron, letting the villain scheme once without popping it and then getting things back under control with the AE thwart and allies. This is one that is worth teching in sometimes!\r\n- **[Breaking and Entering](/card/37015)** was cut because Gambit-J already has so much thwarting potential! With it gone, **[Sense of Justice](/card/14030)** was also dropped\r\n- **[Operative Skill](/card/37013)** was very awkward, since the decision to use an operative counter had to be made before knowing how much *Thief Extraordinaire* would thwart for, either resulting in too much thwart and shutting off his other cards, and/or completely wasting a counter.\r\n- **[Foiled!](/card/09038)** was an idea once [Longshot](/card/35033) joined the crew, since setting up [Longshot](/card/35033) meant leaving Remy vulnerable to scheme boosts on non-confuse turns. The idea was to always be able to calculate incoming threat, but it was often unnecessary, and so many times Remy leaves a 0-boost on top of the deck. It also had bad match-ups, like Master Mold, where it is blank. It does have some good match-ups, like Spiral, and it did save us one game vs Magneto! \r\n\r\n## **Matchups**\r\n\r\nThe current build has won games entirely staying in alter-ego, staying in alter-ego until the final turn, and with a more flipping strategy. Minions can either be ignored or dealt with via allies. With the villain confused and a few 1 SCH minions out, we always have perfect knowledge of the next turn's threat. Being able to ignore things instead of deal with them, generates a lot of tempo, contributing to the feeling of Gambit playing another game entirely from the villain\r\n\r\n- For example, **Mutagen** was an all-AE game until the final turn, confusing Green Goblin and taking a couple threat per turn from minions. [Banshee](/card/34014) is excellent at confusing them, while [Longshot](/card/35033) can instant-delete them when necessary. [Beat Cop](/card/10029) and 2 ATK allies can do some work, and at worst, Remy can don the jacket, flip up and instant-kill with his attack events. \r\n- **Zola** is weak to confuse and has plenty of schemes for [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) to target, while also harboring 0 SCH Quickstrike minions that Gambit excels with. [Longshot](/card/35033) is very strong here\r\n- Against **Drang**, it is important to flip up once early to remove the spear, but once stalwart is gone, perfect AE can be achieved and we don't even mind the indirect from [Badoon Ship](/card/16063). \r\n- **Venom** was easier than expected. Gambit's confuse can outpace Venom's steady and Royal Flush matches up really well with the Bell Tower and Venom's attachments. Down to Earth is a negligible mod for all-AE Gambit and [Charged Card](/card/37006) getting around retaliate is relevant. \r\n- **Project Wideawake** is probably the hardest matchup for this deck, since staying in alter-ego is very risky and steady/stalwart really hampers the ability to slow down scheming. He does match up nicely with [Warn the Others](/card/32099), but this is a tough one.  \r\n- **Master Mold** is also tough, if opting not to use the Magneto ally. MM doesn't get a boost card when scheming, so it is impossible to set the top card of the deck, and stalwart turns off all of the confuse. Gambit will need to build allies and counters early, tanking hits with Natural Agility + Rogue while burning down MM's relatively low health pool. Teching in [Under Surveillance](/card/06031) can go a long way, but this is beatable without it. [Longshot](/card/35033) is very strong here\r\n- **Magneto** is really a great match-up as well, since we dodge his magnets in AE and Remy's high thwarting out of the gate rushes him down to his strained form. \r\n- Scenarios without starting threat are tricky, since Gambit can't trigger *Thief Extraordinaire* or play [Creole Charmer](/card/37009). [Dazzler](/card/37012) makes the best opening here to stay down, but flipping up is also viable. Having a confuse when flipping back down is key\r\n\r\n<img src= \"https://imgur.com/9nxT1WY.jpeg\">\r\n*Assembled and ready to pull off this job!*", "user_id": 8938, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "10029": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32049": 1, "33014": 1, "33020": 1, "33021": 1, "33035": 1, "34014": 1, "34015": 1, "34016": 3, "34021": 1, "34022": 1, "35022": 1, "35033": 1, "36022": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37012": 1, "37021": 3}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme, beginner"}, {"id": 26567, "name": "Gambit - Protection!", "date_creation": "2023-03-03T18:21:48+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-03T18:21:48+00:00", "description_md": "testing out gambit in protection\r\n\r\nwill see how it feels", "user_id": 29613, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01081": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "09020": 1, "10031": 1, "12024": 1, "16024": 1, "19016": 3, "32011": 1, "32012": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32048": 1, "32049": 1, "33035": 1, "36035": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "38010": 1, "38012": 1, "38014": 2, "38016": 3, "38018": 1, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26568, "name": "Captain Giant Draw", "date_creation": "2023-03-03T18:32:37+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-03T18:38:38+00:00", "description_md": "Designed to play with two other ally focused decks.\r\n\r\nDraw your deck with Agent 13, then attack a bunch of times with Goliath.\r\n\r\nRepeat", "user_id": 20517, "investigator_code": "01010a", "investigator_name": "Captain Marvel", "slots": {"01011": 1, "01012": 3, "01013": 3, "01014": 2, "01015": 1, "01016": 1, "01017": 2, "01018": 2, "01086": 3, "01088": 1, "01091": 1, "01092": 1, "03025": 1, "04013": 1, "04015": 1, "04016": 3, "08023": 1, "10030": 3, "21015": 1, "21058": 1, "23016": 3, "27046": 1, "31029": 3, "38028": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "multiplayer"}, {"id": 26569, "name": "Gamora Joins the X-Men", "date_creation": "2023-03-03T18:45:35+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-03T19:35:41+00:00", "description_md": "Cyclops has a new recruit, [Gamora](/card/19020). \r\n\r\nAfter messing around with Rogue builds it got me thinking about mixing traits in other decks. I had tried a Guardians deck with Rogue and realised that making [Gamora](/card/19020) an X-Men allows you to make the most of her amazing ability. \r\n\r\nSo, all you have to do:\r\n- Get [Gamora](/card/19020) into the discard\r\n- Play Gamora with [Make the Call](/card/01071) \r\n- Give her [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035)\r\n- Give her [Danger Room Training](/card/33015)\r\n\r\nThen you can repeatedly attack or thwart with [Gamora](/card/19020) using [Game Time](/card/33022), which gets you an extra card every time.\r\n\r\n3 copies of both [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) and [Danger Room Training](/card/33015) simply allow the setup to happen faster. It is good to keep track of how many of each are left in the deck and be careful not to discard them all.\r\n\r\nThe good part of doing this with Cyclops is that he does not have many hero events. So, you are most likely to hit either [Game Time](/card/33022), [Make the Call](/card/01071), or [Tactical Brillance](/card/33010). The latter of these can then get [Game Time](/card/33022) back from the discard for yet another use! Otherwise, either [Ricochet Beam](/card/33009) or [Full Blast](/card/33008) are still great and let you put out damage fast. \r\n\r\nYou can ready [Gamora](/card/19020) via [Command Team](/card/23016), [Utopia](/card/33020), or even [Professor X](/card/32019) if you want to. Just keep track of her health. She does have 5 health once you have both upgrades, so should be fine. \r\n\r\nThe general strategy is to play safe and get a few upgrades out while waiting for [Gamora](/card/19020). The most important cards are probably [X-Mansion](/card/32049) and [Ruby Quartz Visor](/card/33003). You want to get at least 1 or 2 resource generators out. Early on you can try to stay in alter-ego, especially if you see [Professor X](/card/32019). Cyclops effectively has 7 cards thanks to his Constant Training ability, which does help to set up and play allies. [Priority Target](/card/33007) is great for speeding things up and [Weapon X](/card/35022) can help to go through the deck faster.\r\n\r\nIn general you do want to flip to alter-ego if you have chance to as it simply gives you extra resources and ensures you have a tactic to play as you need. Once [Gamora](/card/19020) is set up you can heal her with [X-Mansion](/card/32049). \r\n\r\nThe allies give a nice selection to choose from for [Make the Call](/card/01071). Once you have [Gamora](/card/19020) out it is very easy to have them available. Then, [Forge](/card/36022) and [Phoenix](/card/33002) allow you to get back important cards that were missed (ie. [X-Mansion](/card/32049) and [Ruby Quartz Visor](/card/33003)). Later on [Phoenix](/card/33002) can pull back [Full Blast](/card/33008) or [Ricochet Beam](/card/33009) for more damage. Defending with [Armor](/card/38012), [Forge](/card/36022), or [Professor X](/card/32019) should be enough. \r\n\r\nTo finish the game you can build up a lot of damage from [Gamora](/card/19020) in one go. Put [Exploit Weakness](/card/33005) on the villain and keep attacking. Each [Gamora](/card/19020) attack will hit for 4. Then, you likely draw into [Ricochet Beam](/card/33009) for 7 or [Full Blast](/card/33008) for 12 to finish the game.", "user_id": 19578, "investigator_code": "33001a", "investigator_name": "Cyclops", "slots": {"01071": 3, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "08031": 1, "19020": 1, "23016": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32049": 1, "33002": 1, "33003": 1, "33004": 1, "33005": 2, "33006": 2, "33007": 2, "33008": 1, "33009": 2, "33010": 3, "33011": 1, "33015": 3, "33020": 1, "33022": 3, "33035": 3, "35022": 1, "36022": 1, "38012": 1, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26570, "name": "Hulk for President - Leadership, Clarity, Ingenuity", "date_creation": "2023-03-03T20:28:09+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-06T18:22:41+00:00", "description_md": "It's been a while since I've played Hulk and I wanted to see if newer cards have opened up some options for him outside of Aggression. The SP//Dr and Ironheart packs have given him a few options that allowed me to play around with this Leadership deck concept.\r\n\r\n[Ingenuity](/card/29027) and [Clarity of Purpose](/card/31029) open up some easy resources to help him play out his hand, since he often has a hard time playing more than one card. Getting one or both of these two out early should help the deck. \r\n\r\n[Assess the Situation](/card/12033) will provide more resources and a larger hand size next turn when it doesn't act as a resource. Both [Ingenuity](/card/29027) and [Assess the Situation](/card/12033) will also fuel [Push Ahead](/card/29018), giving Hulk some much needed thwarting. \r\n\r\nI often find myself with cards left in hand when playing Hulk that I have to discard.

When I first played Iron Man in Champions I was really disappointed in how LONG it took to get his character up and running. Once you got Iron Man to where you could do something, the game was almost over (if you were playing in multi-player). If you were playing solo, the villain threated out fast because you had to stay in alter ego so long. \r\n\r\nSo even though I really liked the Marvel character, I would never play him. But with the addition of other key cards, I think I've found my new FAVORITE deck to play. Introducing my IRON MAN TECK DECK!\r\n\r\nThe key are the protection TECH UPGRADES. [Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031), [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) & [Forcefield Generator](/card/31019) are crucial to getting Iron Man's hand size up to a playable number. AND they have the added benefit of keeping damage off of your hero. \r\n\r\nAlso important are all of the resources added to this deck. Early on, Iron Man will have trouble paying for the cards he needs to lay down. So There are SEVEN doubles and SIX other support cards that can generate resources. This might seem overkill but getting one or two of these support cards out early helps to make up for a starting low hand size.\r\n\r\nHOW I PLAY\r\n\r\nDraw your starting alter-ego 6 cards. Mulligan anything that won't help you. Then play Futurist to get one more card in your hand. Goal is to try to get 2 to 3 cards into play per turn. Once your Iron Man hand size will be 4 then flip to Hero. It can be done with 3 if you have some resource support cards in play. \r\n\r\nKeep playing those tech upgrades and resource generators when you can. Early on, don't use up [Energy Barrier](/card/05017) or [Forcefield Generator](/card/31019) all the way (if you can). Let it stay on the board so you can keep your hand size up. \r\n\r\n[Pepper Potts](/card/01033) is an important card as it will allow you to play any doubles TWICE!  So if you have Pots in play and a double resource in hand, you can get those expensive 4-cost cards out no problem. Simply play the double resource card, exhaust Pots to reuse the same double resource, then you can put into play [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091) or a [Nick Fury](/card/01084). Very powerful.\r\n\r\n[Stark Tower](/card/01034): Great to get spent tech upgrades back into your hand to reuse them.\r\n\r\nOnce you get your hero hand size up to 7 then you're a powerhouse. With all the protection tech upgrades, you get there so much faster.\r\n\r\nWHY CERTAIN CARDS ARE IN THE DECK\r\n\r\n[Electrostatic Armor](/card/10031): At a cost of 1, this is an easy way to a tech upgrade out, especially early. But you can only have one in play at a time. There are two here in the deck to make finding it easier. Once you get one out, the other one becomes a <span class=\"icon-energy\"></span>energy resource generator, useful for [Repulsor Blast](/card/01031).\r\n\r\n[Energy Barrier](/card/05017): This card does THREE amazing things for Iron Man. It gives him the tech upgrades, it protects Iron Man from getting damage AND it causes the enemy/minions to take damage. That a lot for a single card.\r\n\r\n[Forcefield Generator](/card/31019): This soaks up SIX damage and it's an important tech upgrade. It's great to keep you healthy while you're in hero mode building up your tech cards. Downside is you can only have one out at a time. But since it can get used up there can easily one more around the corner you can play. Or [Stark Tower](/card/01034) can put it back into your hand. Plus it's an <span class=\"icon-energy\"></span>energy resource.\r\n\r\n[Black Widow](/card/01075): Mainly used to block any really bad encounter cards that might pop up., especially [Shadow of the Past](/card/01190). \r\n\r\n[Nick Fury](/card/01084): Expensive, but easily affordable later on in the game. Mainly used to help mop up the biggest problem you're facing in the moment.\r\n\r\n[Ever Vigilant](/card/17030): A great card to ready your hero and remove threat.\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF US ALL: Important to get as many doubles as I can in this deck. This helps you pay for important support cards like Avengers Mansion, Nick Fury, Helicarrier, Quincarrier and Ingenuity. \r\n\r\n[The Power of Protection](/card/01079): Again, since hand size will be low when you first flip to the hero, it is important to get those doubles to help pay for important TECH cards or Med Team.\r\n\r\n[Med Team](/card/01080) TEAM: Playing this will help keep your health up so you don't need to flip to alter-ego.\r\n\r\n[Avengers Mansion](/card/01091): Not impossible to get out early. Gives you one extra card in hand which is essential early on.\r\n\r\n[Helicarrier](/card/01092): Another aid to get import cards out early\r\n\r\n[Quincarrier](/card/08023) or [Ingenuity](/card/29027): Important to get out so you can go AERIAL every round. Or it can help pay for the cards in your hand.\r\n\r\n[Down Time](/card/05033): Boost your recovery from 3 to 5. Important because you going from a low of 1 health to a max of 17 can take a while.\r\n\r\nWHERE IS [Repurpose](/card/31016)???  I tried a version of this deck with repurpose, but I honestly never needed to use it.

That's changed completely by [Psylocke](/card/35013). This deck is all about the dynamic partnership of [Psylocke](/card/35013) and [Aamir Khan](/card/05006) which makes it possible to flip every turn as Ms Marvel loves to.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Card choices**\r\n\r\nMs Marvel can absorb a lot of damage and when flipping every turn can easily recover for 7 each time she does so. There's no need to worry too much about defence or having allies to block for you. The question is whether to focus on dealing double damage (with cards like [Melee](/card/05030)) or card draw from [No Quarter](/card/28013), and for true solo I prefer the card draw. [No Quarter](/card/28013) calls for [Follow Through](/card/16045) and [Honed Technique](/card/28017) to maximise your draw power, and [Honed Technique](/card/28017) calls for lots of <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> so that you can play it. Fortunately [Plan of Attack](/card/18013) and [Chase Them Down](/card/01052) are both <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> and work really well in this deck - [Plan of Attack](/card/18013) because you can use it to make sure you find [No Quarter](/card/28013) and [Chase Them Down](/card/01052) because you can play it directly you draw it with [No Quarter](/card/28013).\r\n\r\n[Moon Girl](/card/28018) is difficult to resist in a Champion deck with plenty of <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> but she is maybe a bit marginal. Both [No Quarter](/card/28013) and Teen Spirit will discard her, so she is often best parked under [Bruno Carrelli](/card/05007) when you draw her. Maybe another aggression ally would be a better choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Playing the deck**\r\n\r\nThis is a very straightforward deck. You want to get [Aamir Khan](/card/05006) and [Psylocke](/card/35013) down as soon as possible. Whenever [Psylocke](/card/35013) leaves play, use [Aamir Khan](/card/05006) to put her back on the bottom of the deck and then [Plan of Attack](/card/18013) to hopefully move her off the bottom of the deck and find a [No Quarter](/card/28013). Then flip to Hero form and use the [No Quarter](/card/28013) to blast some hapless minion for 8 damage (plus three extra from [Follow Through](/card/16045)) to draw 6 or 7 cards, hopefully including [Psylocke](/card/35013). Rinse. Repeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to lose with this deck**\r\n\r\nYou can easily lose with this deck by playing against a Stalwart villain. Against Steady villains it is still pretty good because [Psylocke](/card/35013) should be able to attack twice before you spend a turn in Alter Ego. Another good way to lose with this deck is to keep discarding [Psylocke](/card/35013) with Teen Spirit, so do think about easing off on the spirits once you have [Aamir Khan](/card/05006), [Bruno Carrelli](/card/05007) and [Nakia Bahadir](/card/05008) in play. The value of another [Big Hands](/card/05003) or [Sneak By](/card/05004) in hand isn't huge, and even [Wiggle Room](/card/05005) can be got by without, given how quickly you can heal damage on Ms Marvel.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nYou might not have though that [Aamir Khan](/card/05006) was the type of guy to go for an older English aristocratic type, but they pair up beautifully together.

Do\u015b\u0107 toporny. Jest to 1wszy bohater kt\u00f3ry startuje z hand size 5 na Alter Ego oraz 3ci bohater kt\u00f3ry ma na dzie\u0144 dobry handsize mniejszy ni\u017c 5. Ekonomia wa\u017cna rzecz w Marvelu, wi\u0119kszy hand-size = gorsza ekonomia. Pierwszy znak, \u017ce \u0142atwo nie b\u0119dzie.\r\n\r\nNa szcz\u0119\u015bcie mamy sporo zabawek, \u017ceby t\u0119 nasz\u0105 ekonomi\u0119 rozkr\u0119ci\u0107. Z czasem powi\u0119kszymy nasz hand-size dzi\u0119ki [Asgard](/card/06007) I dodamy generatory zasob\u00f3w w postaci dw\u00f3ch [God of Thunder](/card/06008). Tylko trzeba do\u017cy\u0107. I jakim\u015b cudem znale\u017a\u0107 zasoby na zagranie by\u0142o, nie by\u0142o nie tanich dodatk\u00f3w.\r\n\r\nDrugi problem - zbijania zagro\u017cenia. Podobnie jak w przypadku [Spider-Man](/card/01001a) mamy kombinacje ma\u0142ego bazowego Thw z sytuacyjnym narz\u0119dziem do usuwania \u017ceton\u00f3w na schemach czyli [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003). Na papierze brzmi fajnie, no bo synergia z nasz\u0105 zdolno\u015bci\u0105 bohatersk\u0105, doci\u0105g kart jest super, a miniony dla nas to ma\u0142y piku\u015b. Diabe\u0142 jednak tkwi w szczeg\u00f3\u0142ach. Tutaj tym szczeg\u00f3\u0142em jest \"discard until\". W wielu kombinacjach scenariuszy minion\u00f3w w encounter decku jest na lekarstwo. Przy u\u017cywaniu obro\u0144cy 9 \u015bwiat\u00f3w raz dwa potrafimy przepali\u0107 ca\u0142y deck i dorzuci\u0107 \u017cetony akceleracji. I dalej mamy problem z zagro\u017ceniem.\r\n\r\nOstatni problem to [Hammer Throw](/card/06005) a raczej jego koszt. 3 zasoby + cofni\u0119cie na r\u0119ki [Mjolnir](/card/06009), kt\u00f3rego musimy znowu zagra\u0107 za 1 zas\u00f3b. To naprawd\u0119 du\u017co w por\u00f3wnaniu do innych tego typu event\u00f3w.\r\n\r\nNo dobra. Przejd\u017amy do plus\u00f3w, kt\u00f3ry jest do\u015b\u0107 oczywisty. Jeste\u015bmy najlepszym \"minion slayerem\" w grze na ten moment. Z m\u0142otem 3 ataku, overkill, obszarowe obra\u017cenia z [Lightning Strike](/card/06006) za... potencjalnie naprawd\u0119 du\u017co ataku. Na wrog\u00f3w z du\u017c\u0105 liczb\u0105 minion\u00f3w w decku - czujemy si\u0119 jak ryba w wodzie. \r\n\r\nNasz premade deck jest... no... najs\u0142abszy ze wszystkich do tej pory. Nasze karciochy mo\u017cna podzieli\u0107 na 2 minipakiety. Pierwszym z nich jest zestaw powi\u0105zany z mordowaniem minion\u00f3w. I tu pies pogrzebany je\u015bli chodzi o gr\u0119 true solo. Wzmacnia nas g\u0142\u00f3wnie w tym co jest i tak nasz\u0105 najmocniejsz\u0105 stron\u0105. Na solo wolimy by\u0107 jednak bardziej uniwersalni, dwa \u017ce z byciem specjalist\u0105 w dziedzinie zabijania stwork\u00f3w jest troch\u0119 s\u0142abe, gdy... scenariusz nie ma za du\u017co minion\u00f3w. Wtedy p\u0142aczemy.\r\n\r\n- Pierwsz\u0105 kart\u0105 z zestawu jest [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017). Ojj pami\u0119tam jak si\u0119 t\u0119 kart\u0105 zachwyca\u0142em na pocz\u0105tki. Dob\u00f3r 3 kart! Jako upgrade, czyli mo\u017cemy u\u017cywa\u0107 ile wlezie. Do kazdego decku agresji! No ale im wi\u0119cej gram tym mam gorsze zdanie. Przede wszystkim jest wolna. Zu\u017cywamy \u0142\u0105cznie 3 karty by zagra\u0107 i dostajemy pierwsze swoje 3 karty... kto wie? Graj\u0105c solo przy dobrych wiatrach po 2-3 turach. Przy s\u0142abych wiatrach...noo... istnieje szansa, \u017ce nie dobierzemy ich w og\u00f3le. Thor ma troch\u0119 tu \u0142atwiej - mamy 2 osoby na sobie to zagramy [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) zabijemy wszystko i tak z [Lightning Strike](/card/06006), a my dostajemy jeden \u017cetonik w\u0142a\u015bciwie gratis. 2gi problem tej karty, \u017ce dobra\u0107 karciochy z niej mo\u017cemy tylko na Alter Ego. Agresja, szczeg\u00f3lnie Thor ma problemy ze zbijaniem zagro\u017cenia, wi\u0119c ka\u017cdy flip na 2g\u0105 stron\u0119 jest potencjalnie niebezpieczny. Trzeci problem to s\u0142\u00f3wko \"you\" kt\u00f3ra oznacza \u017ce nie dostaniemy zasobu jak miniona zabije nasz sojusznik, brzmi jak nic nie znacz\u0105cy warunek, ale potrafi by\u0107 w praktyce upierdliwy. To warto gra\u0107 Czy nie? Moim zdaniem w tym momencie na Thorze tak, ale musimy pami\u0119ta\u0107, \u017ce to nie jest \u017caden priorytet. I je\u015bli zdajemy sobie spraw\u0119 \u017ce w danym scenariuszu jest ma\u0142o co zabija\u0107 - to nie zagrywamy w og\u00f3le.\r\n\r\n- kolejn\u0105 kart\u0105 jest znana z podstawki [Chase Them Down](/card/01052). Tu r\u00f3wnie\u017c problem ( a jak) taki, \u017ce miniony mo\u017cemy sobie przywo\u0142a\u0107 z [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) przy okazji zbijaj\u0105c zagro\u017cenie. Podsumowuj\u0105c: mo\u017ce zbi\u0107 zagro\u017cenie gdy zbijemy zagro\u017cenie. A nast\u0119pne 3 tury upss...\r\n\r\n- mamy te\u017c [Get Over Here!](/card/06014) projektowane oczywi\u015bcie z my\u015bl\u0105 o synergii z umiejk\u0105 naszego herosa. 0 zasob\u00f3w 1 dmg + doci\u0105g 2 kart? Wspanaile! Jeden, jedyny minus - na solo nie dzia\u0142a ;)\r\n\r\n- Mamy [Hercules](/card/06011). Kosztuj\u0105cego 6. S Z E \u015a \u0106 zasob\u00f3w. W hero kt\u00f3ry ma 4 hand size. Musimy mie\u0107 minimum 2 miniony na stole, \u017ceby jakkolwiek by\u0142 op\u0142acalny. Na solo z obecn\u0105 pul\u0105 kart - nie licz\u0105c jakiego\u015b Ultrona raczej nie realne by mie\u0107 3 miniony na stole.\r\n\r\n- [Battle Fury](/card/06018) - ponownie, karta kt\u00f3ra si\u0119 przydaje tylko jak mamy miniona na stole. 1 zas\u00f3b + 1 dmg za przygotowanie si\u0119 - powiedzmy, \u017ce umiarkowana cena, ale przez to \u017ce potrzebujemy i miniona i potrzebujemy by\u0107 na dzie\u0144 dobry przygotowani... wol\u0119 jednak [Relentless Assault](/card/01053) w to miejsce.\r\n\r\n- [Invulnerability](/card/06021)... FFG ale dlaczego? Przecie\u017c dorzuci\u0142e\u015b do tego zestawu [Enhanced Physique](/card/19033), kt\u00f3ry wsp\u00f3\u0142gra z [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019)... wi\u0119c czemu zamiast tego do precona wsadzi\u0142e\u015b to?!\r\n\r\n\u0141\u0105cznie wyrzuci\u0142em a\u017c 15 kart. Opr\u00f3cz tych co marudzi\u0142em wyrzuci\u0142em dodatkowo [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091) oraz [Heimdall](/card/06020), bo to bardzo drogie karty, a my no... hand size 5/4. Bazowo nawet tego nie zagramy ;) Wi\u0119c wychodzi na to, \u017ce... opr\u00f3cz podw\u00f3jnych zasob\u00f3w zosta\u0142o nam z orygina\u0142u 5 kart... tjaa... to ju\u017c chyba bardziej podchodzi pod nowy deck, ni\u017c przerabianie ;) Ale tak to z mojej perspektywy wygl\u0105da, deck thora wida\u0107, \u017ce mocno by\u0142 zaprojektowany pod multiplayer, gdzie przejmujemy rol\u0119 \"minion slayera\", a reszt\u0105 zajmuj\u0105 si\u0119 inni. Na solo no c\u00f3\u017c... samym zabijaniem minion\u00f3w gry nie wygramy, a z pozosta\u0142ymi aspektami gry trzeba sobie jako\u015b radzi\u0107. \r\n\r\n- Sojusznik\u00f3w nie mamy za du\u017co. Niestety agresja troszk\u0119 jeszcze musi poczeka\u0107 na naprawd\u0119 fajne opcje.\r\n - Zaczynamy od pieseczka [Lockjaw](/card/05018). Brakuje mi s\u0142\u00f3w by podkre\u015bli\u0107 jak bardzo dobra ta by\u0142a karta w tamtych czasach, ratuj\u0105ca ty\u0142ek ka\u017cdemu deckowi kt\u00f3ry ma problem z zbijaniem zagro\u017cenia. \r\n\r\n - [Hulk](/card/01050) jak to Hulk - zawsze kontrowersyjny ;) Na tym etapie gry \u015brednio mo\u017cemy wcisn\u0105\u0107 same pi\u0105stki do decku, ale nie jest te\u017c najgorzej. Mamy a\u017c 20 pi\u0105stek i 10 piorunk\u00f3w (nie licz\u0105c samego Hulka). Szansa na discard Hulka jest relatywnie ma\u0142a (to znaczy teoretycznie, w praktyce to wiadomo :D )\r\n\r\n - [Mockingbird](/card/01083) - agresywne decki bardzo lubi\u0105 stuny wbrew pozorom. Nasza Bobbi zestunuje wbije/thwartuje 2 razy i zablokuje znowu atak z\u0142ola. 2 aktywacje mniej, nie musimy si\u0119 broni\u0107, nie musimy ucieka\u0107 na alter-ego by odzyskiwa\u0107 HPki - 2 tury mo\u017cemy spokojnie wali\u0107 Thorem z\u0142olowi po mordzie ;) \r\n\r\n- z event\u00f3w dorzucili\u015bmy [Relentless Assault](/card/01053) jaka nasza odpowied\u017a na miniony, b\u0119dziemy gra\u0107 mocno agresywnie, wi\u0119c za bardzo czasu na rozbudow\u0119 na tyle by sobie radzi\u0107 za pomoc\u0105 [Lightning Strike](/card/06006) ci\u0119\u017cko. a RA jest fajnie przez to \u017ce ma overkilla przez co ma\u0142e miniony z guardy padaj\u0105 a my lecimy do przodu z dmg. Pi\u0105stk\u00f3w u nas pod dostatkiem.\r\n\r\n- Z support\u00f3w zostawi\u0142em [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) p\u00f3ki co, g\u0142\u00f3wnie dlatego, \u017ce te scenariusze z podstawki i 1wszego cyklu tych minion\u00f3w maj\u0105 jednak sporo, ale na p\u00f3\u017aniejszym etapie p\u00f3jdzie w odstawk\u0119. Dorzuci\u0142em [Helicarrier](/card/01092) w zamian za wyrzucone [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091). Bo ta\u0144sze i bo ma pi\u0105stk\u0119. Ale jako \u017ce staramy si\u0119 by\u0107 do\u015b\u0107 agresywnie to te\u017c zdecydowanie nie zagramy tego w ka\u017cdej grze. Chcemy szybko ko\u0144czy\u0107 gr\u0119, a nie rozbudowywa\u0107 si\u0119 w niesko\u0144czono\u015b\u0107.\r\n\r\n- Przechodz\u0105c do \"apgrejd\u00f3w\":\r\n - jestem prawie pewien, \u017ce tw\u00f3rcy sami, by dodali [Combat Training](/card/01057) gdyby nie jaka\u015b polityka zwi\u0105zana z ilo\u015bci\u0105 reprint\u00f3w na deck. Szczeg\u00f3lnie, \u017ce w ich wersji wyst\u0119powa\u0142 [Battle Fury](/card/06018). Bazowy atak jest wymagany do [Mean Swing](/card/06015), b\u0119dzie te\u017c g\u0142\u00f3wnym narz\u0119dziem do odpalania [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019), tak\u017ce bi\u0107 \"z \u0142apy\" b\u0119dziemy sporo. \r\n - [Enhanced Physique](/card/19033) - jak wspomina\u0142em, karty znajduj\u0105 si\u0119 w pakiecie Thora wi\u0119c nie bardzo rozumiem czemu od razu nie znalaz\u0142y si\u0119 w jego bazowym decku, skoro mamy [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019). Ju\u017c pakiet dalej u czarnej wdowy pojawi si\u0119 [Quincarrier](/card/08023), wi\u0119c wtedy wstawiajcie jego i nasz \"pi\u0105stkowy bank\" mo\u017cna sobie odpu\u015bci\u0107, ale p\u00f3ki co jest ok.\r\n - [Honorary Avenger](/card/03025) - kolejne pi\u0105stki w decku pod Hulka. A tak to wstawione g\u0142\u00f3wnie z my\u015bl\u0105 o [Lockjaw](/card/05018). Przy piesku wychodzi nam 2 zasoby za 2 Thw, jako avenger mamy 1 strza\u0142 wi\u0119cej, wi\u0119c troch\u0119 lepiej pod k\u0105tem zasob\u00f3w wychodzi.\r\n - na koniec [Down Time](/card/05033) - na przeciwnik\u00f3w z mniejsz\u0105 ilo\u015bci HP powinni\u015bmy si\u0119 obej\u015b\u0107 od niego, ale jak si\u0119 gra przed\u0142u\u017ca no to ju\u017c jest fajny. Ka\u017cde wyczerpanie na Rec to atak mniej i niebezpieczne przed\u0142u\u017canie gry. Down Time pozwala troch\u0119 tego ograniczy\u0107.\r\n\r\nI to by by\u0142o na dyle je\u015bli chodzi o deck. Strategia - agresjaaa ;) Atak z \"\u0142apy\" z m\u0142otkiem i z combat training to 4 atk, z [Mean Swing](/card/06015) i [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019) to ju\u017c 9 dmg i ju\u017c si\u0119 robi fajnie. Jak gramy na przeciwnika z ma\u0142\u0105 ilo\u015bci\u0105 HP to powinni\u015bmy raczej prze\u0107 ostro do przodu i ograniczy\u0107 mocno wydawanie zasob\u00f3w na ekonomi\u0119. Jak przeciwnicy maj\u0105 troch\u0119 wi\u0119cej to jednak warto pomy\u015ble\u0107, czy nie uzbroi\u0107 si\u0119 w [Helicarrier](/card/01092) i [God of Thunder](/card/06008), by spamowanie pieska nie kosztowa\u0142o nas ca\u0142\u0105 r\u0119k\u0119.\r\n\r\nZ pozosta\u0142ych rzeczy - warto kontrolowa\u0107 jak wygl\u0105da sytuacja z minionami w scenariuszu. Szczeg\u00f3lnie jak zabieramy si\u0119 do ko\u0144czenia scenariusza. Mo\u017cemy chcie\u0107 u\u017cy\u0107 [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) bo minion wskoczy, ale nie zd\u0105\u017cy zaatakowa\u0107, bo chcemy zako\u0144czy\u0107 gr\u0119, a dobierzemy 2 karty. Ale jak w tym momencie nam wyskoczy np. [Armored Guard](/card/01120) to mo\u017ce nawet nas to kosztowa\u0107 gr\u0119. Z dobrych informacji - scenariusze z 1wszej fali maj\u0105 du\u017co minion\u00f3w, wi\u0119c karty powinny nam si\u0119 sypa\u0107 obficie; ze z\u0142ych informacji - wi\u0119kszo\u015bci maj\u0105 sporo HPk\u00f3w w por\u00f3wnaniu do takich przeciwnik\u00f3w z Red Skulla czy Galaxy Most Wanted.

With the [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) down, he is able to manage threat quite well without flipping to hero form. The [Honor Among Theives](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/26566/honor-among-thieves-1.0) deck that journeyman2 posted already has a pretty amazing write-up on how to play Gambit on that side, so check that one out if you haven't already. \r\n\r\nHowever, one of the most interesting interactions for Gambit's Thief Extraordinaire ability is that he gets to use one card to thwart, but see the next card. This _could_ be used to prepare either your boost card or encounter card for the next villain phase. But... what if you used this knowledge to feed your good boy, [Cosmo](/card/17020)??? Get where this is going???\r\n\r\nSo once you know the next type of card on top of the deck, you can use Cosmo with abandon, knowing he won't take any consequential damage. This is amazing in Aggression now that you can equip Cosmo with an [Energy Spear](/card/22032) and [Enraged](/card/03031). Enraged is the real winner, because that extra point of consequential damage really doesn't matter anymore, and now Cosmo is attacking for 5 free damage every turn with piercing. So then lets add in a [Sidearm](/card/23035), [Boot Camp](/card/13016), give him an [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) and [Attack Training](/card/32043), and now he can swing for 8 per turn! That should solve most of the Alter-Ego damage problems. \r\n\r\nFinal pieces then are to help with being able to stay in Alter-Ego all game. Being in Aggression, we have access to the best confuse-locker out there in [Psylocke](/card/35013) who we can just leave on the table for turns that we didn't pull [Creole Charmer](/card/37009). [Professor X](/card/32019) is also here when we find him, but we also are including all three copies of [X-Men Instruction](/card/37031) to shuffle them both back in quickly. Three copies of [Mutant Education](/card/37021) are also used to get Creole Charmer back into our hand again. But best of all, these 6 cards effectively let us run a 34 card deck with the [X-Mansion](/card/32049) out, as they'll just draw us a new card. They'll let you cycle your deck pretty quickly to find what you need. \r\n\r\nIf you do flip up for a turn (which you will need to do for Honorary X-Men on yourself and Cosmo), if you get to 4 counters, you can also shuffle Rogue in again with this combo and keep playing her for free every time you find her. With the X-Mansion down, you can also heal an X-Men ally over and over again, which is awesome for being able to use Psylocke still, while saving her confuse counters for when they are needed. \r\n\r\n[Marked](/card/33032) may seem like an odd choice, but we are hoping to get so much of our attack out of Cosmo in one go that a poorly timed minion can wreck our plans. With all of the attachments out, Cosmo will be be ranged and have piercing, so Marked helps to provide some timely overkill if the cards line up. \r\n\r\nThe best combo you can hope for would be to use Thief Extraordinaire to remove threat and then use the card knowledge to trigger Cosmo. If you can also play Professor X while you have Honorary X-Men on both Cosmo and Gambit, then with [Utopia](/card/33020) down, you can actually ready both of them... and do it all over again. Amazing!\r\n\r\nThanks for checking out this deck... hope you're all enjoying exploring Gambit as much as I.

That's on top of Damage you do with [Side Step](/card/14015) and [Preemptive Strike](/card/05014). Since you can consistently block twice with [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005) (and perhaps even a third time with [Side Step](/card/14015), Minions will also take damage.\r\n\r\nI'll mention that this Deck in an early iteration had [Dauntless](/card/16016) in it, for a further 1 damage.

[Royal Flush](/card/37007)\r\n- 2 tsp [Surprise Attack](/card/13014)\r\n- Cajun seasoning ([Assess the Situation](/card/12033), [Mutant Education](/card/37021), [Plan of Attack](/card/18013), [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047), [Assault Training](/card/26033), & [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010))\r\n\r\nLe's started wit de jambalaya. De first step is to decide how many o' you's eatin' dis fine feast. If you alone, just make sure you flippin' every round an' usin' all your tricks. Dat mean your good ol' *Thief Extraordinaire* in Alter-ego to remove some threat and set up for your boost or encounter card. Den you gotta confuse as much as you can wit [Professor X](/card/32019) and [Creole Charmer](/card/37009). But dat's not necessary, especially if you invite de whole neighborhood to de cookout. In multiplayer, you don't need to flip as much, but you should still be flippin' most turns. Gen'rally I still flip every turn but sometime I'll take two turns in a row stayin' up.\r\n\r\nAfter you decide dat, you ready to get started seasonin' de meat wit dat good ol' cajun seasonin', den saut\u00e9 until nice an' brown. Take one o' dem slotted spoons and set it aside. We gon' need it for later.\r\n\r\nWhat we got here is a lot o' flavors all workin' together. You can't 'ave jus' one, non?\r\n\r\n- [Charged Card](/card/37006) great for Overkill on minions, to pierce tough statuses, or to avoid retaliate. It's a bit more expensive compared to de other cards though, but it's modular, so you can just spend counters for what you need.\r\n- [One by One](/card/28014) is the most efficient attack, but only if you have a minion you need to defeat. If you just hittin' de villain, it don't do as much.\r\n- [Precision Strike](/card/35018) is a great way to heal up. [Moment of Triumph](/card/12030) just don't do well since it only works with [Charged Card](/card/37006) really, and your charge counters can make sure you get dat healin'. But den it don't do as well if you just want to attack de villain, just like One by One. Unlike One by One, you not getting that extra damage, so it's a trade-off no?\r\n- [Royal Flush](/card/37007) is one o' de best. It does 3 damage 3 times when you got 3 charge counters (remember dat you can't use the counter it give on itself. Just one o' dem timin' tings). But you can clear 3 minions, or put all de damage into de villain, some o' dis, some o' dat, whatever you need, but you *need* charge counters, and dis card is expensive, double de cost of most of o' de others, so you don't play it dat often. But when you do, it hit *juuuust* right, d'accord?\r\n- [Surprise Attack](/card/13014) may seem like a... surprise to be sure, but it's a welcome one, d'accord? You got plenty o' ways to pay for it wit de [The X-Jet](/card/32020) and [Martial Prowess](/card/10018), and dere ain't notin' better den de feelin' o' shufflin' in one o' dose cards with [Assault Training](/card/26033), flippin' up to hero, drawin' it off o' ol' [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018) and playin' it right away.\r\n\r\n![chef's kiss](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082259097329598575/57c9c347-6468-41c4-af5b-5907aa2887ff-2176527484.png)\r\n\r\nDe most important ting is dat you are usin' de best attack for de job. We got lots goin' on in dis stew to make sure dat happen.\r\n\r\n![cajun crime](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082222554191773806/the-secret-ingredient-is-crime-jbone666.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter dat, dis cajun seasin'll add a lot o' flavor.\r\n- [Assess the Situation](/card/12033): since we ain't got many cards over 1 cost, dem doubles can stay in de cabinet. Dis here let you just pay for cards or go for a bigger hand next round.\r\n- [Mutant Education](/card/37021) let you shuffle in some great cards. Usually I'm gettin' [Rogue](/card/37002), [Creole Charmer](/card/37009), or [Molecular Acceleration](/card/37010), but sometime you need to close out de game and go for [Charged Card](/card/37006) or [Royal Flush](/card/37007). Don't worry about not drawin' dat extra card with de ol' [X-Mansion](/card/32049). You don't really need de healin', but maybe you at a table where someone else bringin' one along, you be very happy, non?\r\n- [Plan o' Attack](/card/18013) is de best for grabbin' exactly what you need. Look at 7 cards in Alter-ego or just 4 in Hero, but you can dig for exactly de right ting for de job. With 12 attacks in de deck, [Mutant Education](/card/37021) and [Assault Trainin'](/card/26033) ta shuffle 'em back in, you can be sure you also findin' de right one.\r\n- [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047) got a bit o' kick! Add it to anyting and it gives you more damage. Obviously de best is when you can use it to pay for [Royal Flush](/card/37007), but dat don't happen often. It's still great with anything though. Use it on a Surprise Attack to hit for 5! Save a counter on [One by One](/card/28014) or [Precision Strike](/card/35018), or get some extra overkill with [Charged Card](/card/37006).\r\n- [Assault Training](/card/26033) gets a lot of good value. Flip down to Alter-ego and shuffle in a [Surprise Attack](/card/13014) for next turn. Shuffle in a [Plan of Attack](/card/18013), den draw wit [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) or [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018). Lots of great options.\r\n\r\n![base](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082227236251389983/stir_in_the_base.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Makin' de Base**\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n- 2 cups [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017)\r\n- 2 cups [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018)\r\n- 3 cups [The X-Jet](/card/32020)\r\n- 2 cups [Martial Prowess](/card/10018)\r\n\r\nA good jambalaya always end wit' a proper base. Be sure to add all dese ingredients early and let simmer for a few turn to get all de flavor. Mix in de [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017), [Moira MacTaggert](/card/38018), [The X-Jet](/card/32020), and de [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) in a large pot, like dem ones for boilin'. Turn it up real high now and keep stirrin' it. Den right when it 'bout to boil, you turn it right down to a simmer and den add in everyting else. Now you gotta proper jambalaya make anyone jealous.\r\n\r\n[Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) gets a lot o' use here because we flippin' a lot to alter-ego and drawin' cards's never been easier. Normally in other recipes you gotta wait till you get 6 tokens, flip, draw, then draw before you flip again on the next turn, but here you just flippin' anyway, so you can always draw at 3. Moira here to help dat card draw almost every other turn and really brings out de flavor of our spices like [Surprise Attack](/card/13014)--always a good surprise to draw one o' dose. Just remember de X-Jet ain't great for Alter-Ego. If you worried about somethin' like dat, you can always add a [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035), but I don't tink it necessary. A li'l [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) go a long way. Helps pay for any attack event, but also get de kicker for Surprise Attack. Don't skip on it and get one o' dem off-brands Dis here primo and worth it to buy de real deal.\r\n\r\n**Side Dishes**\r\n\r\nYou can't jus have jambalaya by itself! Be sure to add some side dishes. You c'n choose de best for you, but dis ol' cajun got some recommendation dujour.\r\n\r\n- [Professor X](/card/32019) is good for confusin' de villain and givin' you a reprieve in Alter-ego and Hero by blockin' a' attack as well. Good ol' Prof'll save you when you need it.\r\n- [Rogue](/card/37002) will do de same. I was de thief but she stole my heart, so how 'bout dat? She'll often be free to play with all your charge counters, and she a Tough lady--*literally*. That tough will save yer bacon.\r\n- [Sunfire](/card/35014) is a cheap ally that can do a lot o' tings, but most importantly, he can clear dose really tough attachments. If you don't need him for dat, there are some other options. We'll go over dem later.\r\n- [Creole Charmer](/card/37009) can help the Professor with confusin' de villain. Use your *Thief Extraordinaire* ability to get sometin' low and den clear it wit your charms.\r\n- [Natural Agility](/card/37008) is good sometimes. De best ting is you get charge counters when you use it, but if you have your trusty [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005), it helps you to ready.\r\n- [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) is fine. It's extra thwarting and can sometimes draw you a card, but don't count on it. Dey's not the most reliable. Remember dat it remove 1 threat, not one additional, so you need sometin' exactly 1 threat remaining to get de card.\r\n- [Battle Fury](/card/35015) is great. You don't always need it, but generally try to use it if you're exhausted and ready to go down t'Alter-ego so you can thwart a la *Thief Extraordinaire*. In dose desperate times, you c'n heal up (for a net of 2 cos it deal you 1 damage, n'est pas? But sometime you really need it).\r\n- [Gambit's Guild Armor](/card/37005) is a 1 cost upgrade dat say: 'you always defend and sometimes you ready after'. It works great with [Natural Agility](/card/37008), and helps you to keep up your *Thief Extraordinaire*.\r\n- [Gambit's Staff](/card/37004) is just free damage. Every time an enemy attack, you gone do 1 damage to it. If it got 1 health when it attack, he don't attack. It's an interrupt, so it's great for free damage but also sometime save yo' life.\r\n\r\n![it's a trap](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082202312392593500/1082257594590171189/spice8rank.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Substitutions**\r\n\r\nNot everyting will work in dis recipe. [Warrior Skill](/card/35016), [Honed Technique](/card/28017), [Energy](/card/01088), [Genius](/card/01089), n' [Stren'th](/card/01090) all don't fittin' here. Dere's too many resources if you includin' all o' dis here. Heck, as it is we got too many, an' we only got deux! Honed is way too much setup when all our Aggression events only 1 cost. If you goin' for [No Quarter](/card/28013), best go all de way and commit to it. It's good, but ain't doin' any good here.\r\n\r\nAn' dat big elephant in de room, [Warrior Skill](/card/35016). It's great synergy here. You get 9 extra damage when you usin' all dem counters for [Royal Flush](/card/37007), but how many time you draw de best hand? How many time you got 3 counters already, want to attack de villain, got enough counters, etc. etc. Sure, it happen a lot, but not 3 times per game. [Aggressive Energy](/card/32047) already do what you want it to do.\r\n\r\nBut dese are de cards dat almost made de cut:\r\n- [Cosmo](/card/17020): a late edition thanks to teamcanadahockey2002; goes great with *Thief Extraordinaire*. It's untested cos well, I ain't thought of it, but it sounds kinda perfect.\r\n- [Hulk](/card/01050) / [Throg](/card/25014): great for soakin' up some more damage, but [Precision Strike](/card/35018) did lots o' great work to keepin' tings healthy.\r\n- [Psylocke](/card/35013): she great but she cost a pretty penny. If you need more confuse, like dose scenarios with lots o' villains. Definitely useful.\r\n- [Angela](/card/18011) / [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043): dis not necessary. You can try to do it, but you lose a lot cos you're always diggin' for stuff wit [Plan o' Attack](/card/18013). You don't need to dig for minions cos you drawin' enough with [Hall of Heroes](/card/06017) seein' as y'don' need t' wait 'til you get 6.\r\n- [X-Men Instruction](/card/37031): dis a great card. Problem is you can get [Rogue](/card/37002) wit [Mutant Education](/card/37021) and dat's de best ally most o' de time. If'n you need more one-o-one time wit de Prof, maybe throw in one o' dese.\r\n- [X-Mansion](/card/32049)'s not bad but not necessary. You don't really need de healin' for me, and most allies dey's jus temporary. If'n you playin' multiplayer and someone need an [X-Mansion](/card/32049), might as well be you.\r\n- [X-Gene](/card/38019) is good if you want to play your own events more than your Aggression ones, especially for [Creole Charmer](/card/37009), since de ol' [The X-Jet](/card/32020) can't do it. I find de Aggression events usually doin' de trick most o' de time, but Creole Charmer definitely gets a lot of use.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to journeyman2, Schmendrix, & Man-is-Obsolete for all de testing and recommendations. De most important ting to remember now is good cajun cookin' take time. You rush it? And next ting you know, some angry brit yellin' at you in your kitchen.

Rather than the regular Justice approach, though, I thought it would be interesting to try Aggression, now that [Psylocke](/card/35013) is available. \r\n\r\n**Card choices**\r\n\r\n[Tac Team](/card/01056) is a card I used to play a lot when I only had the core set, but it doesn't get that much love now. With [Sky-Destroyer](/card/27055) in play, though, it puts out decent damage, bypasses Retaliate, and you can squeeze a little extra damage out of each one with [Dum Dum Dugan](/card/27047). So I decided to make this a crossover X-Men/S.H.I.E.L.D. deck.\r\n\r\n**Playing the deck**\r\n\r\nThe deck is designed to be played mainly in Alter Ego, but you won't wan to be exclusively in Alter Ego as you need some charge counters (ideally 4 or more) to discount the cost of [Rogue](/card/37002). [Ready to Rumble](/card/21022) allows you to use Thief Extraordinaire even on turns that you go over to Hero side. I can't stress enough how important this ability is. The threat removed isn't always great but the ability to choose which card you put back on top of the encounter deck is huge, especially when the villain is confused. You can avoid [Advance](/card/01186) or cards like [Hela's Cloak](/card/21148) that would completely wreck your strategy, and remain in complete control of the game. That's also why [Crew Quarters](/card/20029) is a key piece here, letting you recover any damage you take in Hero form without exhausting, which would make you miss another Thief Extraordinaire opportunity. If you have plenty of HP left, you can couple [Crew Quarters](/card/20029) with [Weapon X](/card/35022) for an extra resource. \r\n\r\nAs you are using Thief Extraordinaire every turn, [The Thieves Guild](/card/37003) is an incredible card too, even if you don't get the card draw it is still one threat off a scheme every turn. Fantastic value.\r\n\r\n**How to lose with this deck**\r\n\r\nAs a confuse lock deck, this is obviously weaker against Steady and Stalwart villains. It also takes a little while for the deck to thin out and give you reasonable certainty of a confuse every turn. Try to hold [Psylocke](/card/35013) on the bench for as long as possible and always use another source of confuse in preference to her.\r\n\r\nYou can also struggle if several minions come out of the deck at the same time. That's another reason why it is important to go into Hero at least once and build up a few charge counters so a fully charged [Royal Flush](/card/37007) is an option in cases like those.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a deck for control freaks. With Confuse and Thief Extraordinaire you can have a grip of every part of the game and just whittle the villain to nothing.", "user_id": 8703, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01056": 3, "01083": 1, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "01092": 1, "04020": 1, "12033": 3, "13016": 1, "20029": 1, "27046": 1, "27047": 1, "27055": 1, "32019": 1, "32048": 1, "32051": 1, "35013": 1, "35022": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37030": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26644, "name": "Gambit-Aggressive Recycling", "date_creation": "2023-03-06T14:50:32+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-06T14:50:32+00:00", "description_md": "Built for a Multiplayer game (Sharing the Boot Camp with Cyclops Leadership).\r\nAn educated Remy recycles his molecular acceleration and Creole Charm, with a view to regular switching to make best use of confuse of AE abilities).", "user_id": 7874, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01092": 1, "13016": 1, "27046": 1, "28014": 3, "28017": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32042": 1, "32047": 2, "32049": 1, "35013": 1, "35014": 1, "35016": 2, "36026": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37021": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": "multiplayer"}, {"id": 26645, "name": "Gambit-Aggressive Recycling", "date_creation": "2023-03-06T15:38:34+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-06T15:38:34+00:00", "description_md": "Built for a Multiplayer game (Sharing the Boot Camp with Cyclops Leadership).\r\nAn educated Remy recycles his molecular acceleration and Creole Charm, with a view to regular switching to make best use of confuse of AE abilities).", "user_id": 7874, "investigator_code": "37001a", "investigator_name": "Gambit", "slots": {"01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01092": 1, "13016": 1, "28014": 3, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "32042": 1, "32047": 2, "32049": 1, "33019": 1, "33035": 1, "35013": 1, "35014": 1, "35016": 2, "36026": 1, "37002": 1, "37003": 1, "37004": 1, "37005": 1, "37006": 3, "37007": 2, "37008": 2, "37009": 2, "37010": 2, "37021": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "2.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26646, "name": "Miles Morales explora el multiverso", "date_creation": "2023-03-06T15:39:09+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-06T15:39:09+00:00", "description_md": "Mazo preparado exclusivamente para jugar la campa\u00f1a de Motivos siniestros.\r\nPocas cartas de liderazgo y muchas b\u00e1sicas pensando en sacar el m\u00e1ximo partido posible a los guerreros ara\u00f1a que hay en el juego.", "user_id": 13317, "investigator_code": "27030a", "investigator_name": "Spider-Man", "slots": {"01071": 2, "01074": 3, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "01092": 1, "04016": 1, "06032": 3, "12024": 1, "13018": 1, "13024": 2, "27017": 1, "27018": 1, "27023": 1, "27031": 2, "27032": 2, "27033": 2, "27034": 3, "27035": 1, "27036": 1, "27037": 1, "27038": 1, "27039": 2, "27048": 1, "27049": 1, "28020": 1, "29015": 1, "30020": 1, "30021": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer"}, {"id": 26647, "name": "Rocket Raccoon Gets Justice", "date_creation": "2023-03-06T16:52:47+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-06T16:52:47+00:00", "description_md": "Rocket likes to do it all.

Introducing **[Vision](/card/26001a)**, The Scheme Destroyer Damage Soaking Tank.\r\n \r\nThe all-wise Android in his **[Intangible](/card/26002)** form cannot attack or defend, but all damage he receives, from each attack, is reduced by 2, which makes him a tank who can ignore all minions with 2 or less ATK (currently **78%** of all minions, including those from Nemesis packs. **Note**: Yes, Villainous minions might be problematic), but also this ability makes him limit the amount of damage received from Villain attacks. With such a powerful defensive capability, playing him in Protection is somewhat overlooked as he can shine on Justice and Leadership, but I think Protection might give him an ace up his sleeve.\r\n\r\n**All About Threat Control**\r\n\r\nIn **[Intangible](/card/26002)** form, all Vis can do in his turn is Thwart, and this deck will emphasize on that, leaving damage dealing to another player, until very specific turns, where a combination of cards might be used to deal a good chunk of damage. This means this deck is suited for Multiplayer, though at the end of the write-up I'll put up a few alternatives for true solo.\r\n\r\n**Starting Strategy**\r\n\r\nThere are a few key upgrades for this deck to shine, and thus a strong alternatives for a mulligan. **[Solar Gem](/card/26005)** should be your immediate priority, as it not only grants you an extra resource per turn, but also puts you in the Air, which is key for the ace up the sleeve I mentioned earlier. **[Deft Focus](/card/16024)** is another great card to key for at the start, as it'll make playing your signature events easier. Then, we're talking about less dire needs, but useful cards that go well together, like **[Endurance](/card/05023)** and **[Dauntless](/card/16016)**, which combined with the tanking ability of Vis can make you Retaliate for a long time. And **[Down Time](/card/05033)** that ensures you REC for 5 on Intangible and for a whopping 7! on Dense form. My initial mulligan would target for those cards, mainly. If you manage to get a few of them early in the game, you'll surely won't ever die. **[Vision's Cape](/card/26006)** is good as well, but situational, as we're gonna be staying for long on Intangible it's only worth it when you play a heavy stun/confuse scenario.\r\n\r\n**The Damage Soaking Tank**\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, Vision in Intangible form excels at soaking damage. When you're against stronger villains, **[Subdue](/card/19018)** will almost always ensure you receive no damage (unless a bad luck boost card), meanwhile **[Energy Barrier](/card/05017)** can help limit damage to 1 or 2 if unlucky, while also dealing a damage or taking down a tough. Against minions, you can almost always ignore them, except for those heavy hitters, for whom this deck has a couple copies of **[Pinned Down](/card/33034)** that can make you ignore them again, forever. Finally, if you're in trouble, 3 of the deck's 5 allies can soak up hits, **[Victor Mancha](/card/26015)** can soak up 2 or 3 if extremely lucky, while **[Jocasta](/card/26013)** and **[Ironheart](/card/13018)** can help once.\r\n\r\n**The Scheme Destroyer**\r\n\r\nYou will thwart for 2 every turn. EVERY turn (ok, except for a few exceptions), but you will have a lot of help as well. **[Just Passing Through](/card/26010)** might be one of the best thwart cards in the game, allowing you to bypass the Crisis icon and Patrol keyword, and with **[Deft Focus](/card/16024)** out, it's free to play. **[Solar Beam](/card/26008)** also benefits from Deft Focus, and allows you to thwart for 5, despite being a steeper cost. **[Vivian](/card/26003)** allows you to thwart for 6 (or 9 if you pair her with a **[Reboot](/card/26024)**), and **[Machine Man](/card/26022)** can thwart up to 12, given you can spend the resources to boost him. I would advice you don't chump block with them, unless you're in real trouble, or in Machine Man's case if you're up to 2 damage and prefer to use the resources on other things. Finally, **[Jocasta](/card/26013)** is helpful as well, with a 2-thwart and a block, albeit a bit expensive.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the ace under the sleeve. **[Ever Vigilant](/card/17030)** is the reason why I play this on Protection. Given you are Aerial, this card allows you to thwart for up to 6 in a turn, with 2 of those going to the Main Scheme, and the other 4 at free will. It aso allows you to combo with an ATK or two, (given you phase change), or a REC (given you flip to AE).\r\n\r\n**Flipping Down**\r\n\r\nOk, this is the elephant in the room. Flipping down to AE might be something you almost never want to do, surely with the thwart potential of this deck you can deal easily with a Villain SCH, but if you're surrounded by minions, this might amount to trouble, specially on main schemes with low thresholds. If you're running low on health, and in danger of dying, it might be wise to prepare for the flipping down turn. Taking care of minions might be hard on this deck, and you'll almost definetely need help from a damage dealing partner, but you can also use your events to deal some damage. The turn you plan on flipping down, it's wise you change to Dense form, use your basic Attack, if you manage to have **[Vivian](/card/26003)** out use her as well, then use either **[Superdense Strike](/card/26009)** and/or **[Solar Beam](/card/26008)** to take care of minions (yes, the latter is overkill and only needs to be used on an emergency, you're much better off using Superdense Strike). Now, how you'll be able to ensure you have your events in your hand you ask? **[Density Control](/card/26007)** is the key, as it'll allow you to fish out any Vision event from your discard pile when you change Mass Form. Make sure you have at least one (hopefully both) of them out before that turn.\r\n\r\nAlso, flipping down while in Dense form will boost your REC to 5 (7 if you have **[Down Time](/card/05033)** out), albeit at the cost of a 5-card hand (but the cost curve of this deck, makes this inconsequiential), so you'll probably need just one Villain Phase in AE to go back to full health. Then, prepare to thwart and thwart and thwart next turn (it might be wise, if possible to save one **[Density Control](/card/26007)** if possible to fish out **[Just Passing Through](/card/26010)** or keep one **[Solar Beam](/card/26008)** to thwart on the next turn.\r\n\r\n**Dealing Damage**\r\n\r\nKnowing when to rush is maybe one of the elite skills in Marvel Champions. In Vision's case (also real in Phoenix), converting the hero from a thwarting one to an attacking one makes him so fun to play. I've played this deck alongside a damage dealing partner, and I always manage to end the games with Vision dealing somewhere around 15 damage. The way to do this is detailed in the previous section, changing form, fishing out events and hopefully having Vivian out.\r\n\r\n**Rest of the Deck**\r\n\r\nThe only signature card you won't use much (or at all...) is **[Mass Increase](/card/26012)**, as you almost always either finish the game or are in Alter Ego when in Dense form.\r\n\r\nFrom the rest of the cards, **[Phase Disruption](/card/26011)** is super useful but situational, as it'll allow you to confuse the Villain (which will lead to flipping to AE even easier) and also will discard a Villain attachment, **[616 Hickory Branch Lane](/card/26004)** is great for fishing out Vivian, but again as you flip down so little is situational as well, and it's always good to have a **[Quincarrier](/card/08023)** out, making this low-cost deck even cheaper. I'm even thinking of cutting the 3 double resource cards, but that's for a v2.0 maybe.\r\n\r\n**Obligation and Nemesis**\r\n\r\nYes, the **[Obligation](/card/26028)** is a problem, as it'll command you to spend a turn in AE immediately. When this pops up and you're surrounded by minions is where this deck's Achilles Heel, I'd say. The good thing is that you can quickly and easily deal with it forever.\r\n\r\n**[Ultron](/card/26029)** is super dangerous as well, as his **[Scheme](/card/26030)** will put the **[Ultron Drones](/card/26031)** environment into play, and thus every attack from Ultron, despite not dealing damage will rid you of one of your cards and put another minion against you. Killing Ultron is a priority when he comes out. I've got to say that if **[Dauntless](/card/16016)** is active, you'll kill all minions for free if you stay in Hero and Intangible form.\r\n\r\n**Playing True Solo**\r\n\r\nAs I said above, this deck is intended for multiplayer purposes and I think it  shines as a threat controller, paired with a damage dealing hero. But if you're playing true solo, you might need a bit of help.\r\n\r\n**[Nova](/card/05012)** is a must-include. He will help in dealing damage and with a high number of **<span class=\"icon-energy\"></span>** resources, he might help in killing minions, so keeping him on the Board might be useful. **[Luke Cage](/card/01076)** is expensive, but can deal a lot of damage. **[Protector](/card/26014)** is also useful, as you can pair him with any of your resource generators to get 3 ATK for 1 consequential damage, and also is a target for **[Reboot](/card/26024)**. I think that's what you could add, unfortunately most of the useful events have the Attack keyword and thus cannot be used on Intangible form. I'd remove **[Jocasta](/card/26013)**, **[Victor Mancha](/card/26015)** and **[Ironheart](/card/13018)**.\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful thinking of other Basic cards to add, I didn't look much at them during this writeup.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Versi\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1ol**\r\n\r\n\r\nAs\u00ed que me cuentas que existe un H\u00e9roe que puede controlar el Tablero a su antojo y ser inmortal? Presentando a **[Vision](/card/26001a)**, El Tanque Absorbe Da\u00f1o Destructor de Planes.\r\n \r\nEl Androide Sabelotodo, en su forma **[Intangible](/card/26002)** no puede atacar ni defender, pero todo el da\u00f1o que recibe, de todos los ataques, es reducido por 2, lo que lo convierte en un tanque, que derechamente puede ignorar a todos los Esbirros con 2 ATQ o menos (actualmente el **78%** de todos los Esbirros, Incluyendo los de los packs de Archienemigos. **Nota**: Si, los Esbirros con Infame pueden ser problem\u00e1ticos), as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n limitar el da\u00f1o producido por los ataques del Villano. Con esa capacidad defensiva tan poderosa, jugarlo en Protecci\u00f3n es mirado en menos a veces, ya que es una bestia en Justicia y Liderazgo, pero en mi opini\u00f3n, Protecci\u00f3n le da un As bajo la manga.\r\n\r\n**Maestro Controlando la Amenaza**\r\n\r\nEn su forma **[Intangible](/card/26002)**, Vis s\u00f3lo puede Interceptar en su turno, y este mazo va a enfocarse en eso, dejando los ataques para otro jugador, salvo en turnos muy espec\u00edficos, donde cierta combinaci\u00f3n de cartas le permitan hacer mucho da\u00f1o. Esto significa que este mazo est\u00e1 pensado para ser jugado en Multijugador principalmente. Igual, al final de esta rese\u00f1a, pondr\u00e9 algunas cartas alternativas para jugar con 1 s\u00f3lo h\u00e9roe.\r\n\r\n**Estrategia Inicial**\r\n\r\nHay algunas mejoras claves para que este mazo brille, y por ende son objetivos importantes de cara a la mano inicial y por lo tanto a su renovaci\u00f3n. **[Gema Solar](/card/26005)** es tu primera prioridad, no s\u00f3lo porque te entrega un recurso extra por turno, sino porque tambi\u00e9n te permite ser a\u00e9reo, lo que es clave para el As bajo la manga que habl\u00e9 anteriormente. **[Concentraci\u00f3n Eficaz](/card/16024)** es otra carta muy buena para apuntar al comienzo, ya que har\u00e1 que juegues tus eventos propietarios m\u00e1s f\u00e1cilmente. Despu\u00e9s, en prioridades m\u00e1s bajas, hay dos cartas que trabajan muy bien en equipo, **[Aguante](/card/05023)** e **[Intr\u00e9pido](/card/16016)**, ya que combinado con las capacidades de Tanque de Vis te van a dar Represalia 1 durante gran parte de la partida. Y **[Tomarse un Respiro](/card/05033)** asegura que te puedas REC por 5 en Intangible y por un incre\u00edble 7! en Denso. Mi renovaci\u00f3n de mano apuntar\u00eda a esas cartas, prioritariamente. Si logras tener en juego algunas de ellas temprano en la partida, te aseguro que no morir\u00e1s. **[Capa de la Visi\u00f3n](/card/26006)** es una buena mejora tambi\u00e9n, pero es sumamente situacional, ya que vamos a pasar gran parte de la partida en Intangible, por lo que es s\u00f3lo \u00fatil en escenarios donde el Villano/Esbirros te dejen mucho en Aturdido o Confundido.\r\n\r\n**El Tanque Absorbe Da\u00f1o**\r\n\r\nComo dije anteriormente, Vision en Intangible es un tanque absorbiendo el da\u00f1o. Incluso cuando peleas contra un Villano fuerte, **[Sometimiento](/card/19018)** normalmente va a asegurarte de no recibir da\u00f1o (salvo muy mala suerte con la carta de aumento), mientras que **[Barrera de Energ\u00eda](/card/05017)** va a ayudar a limitar el da\u00f1o a 1 o 2 puntos de da\u00f1o si tienes mala suerte, al mismo tiempo que entrega 1 da\u00f1o o quita un Duro. Al pelear con Esbirros, la verdad es que puedes ignorarlos largamente, excepto por esos que tengan m\u00e1s de 2 ATQ, en cuyo caso este mazo tiene un par de copias de **[Retenido](/card/33034)** que te pueden hacer ignorarlos para siempre. Finalmente, si de verdad est\u00e1s en problemas, 3 de los Aliados del mazo pueden ayudarte a bloquear, **[Victor Mancha](/card/26015)** puede absorber 2 o 3 ataques (con mucha suerte), mientas que **[Yocasta](/card/26013)** e **[Ironheart](/card/13018)** pueden recibir uno.\r\n\r\n**El Destuctor de Planes**\r\n\r\nVas a INT por 2 todos los turnos. TODOS los turnos (ok, excepto por algunas excepciones), pero as\u00edmismo tendr\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n un mont\u00f3n de ayuda para esto. **[Pasar a Trav\u00e9s](/card/26010)** puede ser una de las mejoras cartas de INT del juego, ya que te permite ignorar el \u00edcono de Crisis y Patrulla, y con **[Concentraci\u00f3n Eficaz](/card/16024)** abajo, es gratis! **[Rayo Solar](/card/26008)** tambi\u00e9n se beneficia de Concentraci\u00f3n Eficaz, y te permite eliminar 5 de amenaza, pero a un precio m\u00e1s elevado. **[Vivian](/card/26003)** te permite quitar 6 de amenaza (o 9 si tienes un **[Reinicio](/card/26024)**), y **[Hombre M\u00e1quina](/card/26022)** puede quitar hasta 12 de amenaza, siempre y cuando tengas los recursos para aumentarlo. Yo recomendar\u00eda no bloquear con ellos, salvo que est\u00e9s en problemas o si a Hombre M\u00e1quina le queda 1 de vida y no quieres gastar m\u00e1s recursos. Para terminar, **[Yocasta](/card/26013)** Es \u00fatil tambi\u00e9n, quitando 2 de amenaza, pero es un poco cara quiz\u00e1s.\r\n\r\nY ahora, el As bajo la manga. **[Vigilancia Constante](/card/17030)** es la raz\u00f3n que me hizo jugar a Vision en Protecci\u00f3n. Si est\u00e1s A\u00e9reo, esta carta te permite quitar hasta 6 de amenaza en un turno, con 2 obligatoriamente yendo al plan principal y los otros 4 a tu arbitrio. Tambi\u00e9n podr\u00edas combinar con un ATQ (si cambias de fase) o con un REC (si te vuelves a Alter Ego).\r\n\r\n**Girar a Alter Ego**\r\n\r\nOk, este es el Elefante en la habitaci\u00f3n. Girar a Alter Ego va a ser algo que jam\u00e1s querr\u00e1s hacer. Seguro, con el potencial de INT que tiene este mazo, vas a poder lidiar sin probelas con el PLA de un Villano, pero si est\u00e1s rodeado de Esbirros, la verdad te puedes complicar mucho, especialmente en Planes Principales con bajos l\u00edmites de Amenaza. Si est\u00e1s con la vida muy baja y en peligro de morir, puede ser \u00fatil prepararse para ese turno en el que pasar\u00e1s en Alter ego. Reducir el n\u00famero de los Esbirros puede ser dif\u00edcil con este mazo y seguro necesitar\u00e1s ayuda de tu compa\u00f1ero de partida, pero tambi\u00e9n puedes usar algunos de tus Eventos para hacer da\u00f1o. El turno en que te planifiques para irte Alter ego, es sensato cambiarte a Denso, usar tu ataque b\u00e1sico y si tienes la suerte de tener a **[Vivian](/card/26003)** abajo, atacar con ella tambi\u00e9n y luego usar **[Golpe Superdenso](/card/26009)** y/o **[Rayo Solar](/card/26008)** para destruir Esbirros (si, Rayo Solar es excesivo y caro, s\u00f3lo para uso en emergencias dir\u00eda yo). Ahorarabien, c\u00f3mo nos aseguramos de tener esos eventos en tu mano, preguntar\u00e1s? **[Conrol de la Densidad](/card/26007)** es la clave, ya que te permite \"pescar\" un evento de Vision de la pila de descartes al cambiarte de fase. Aseg\u00farate de tener al menos uno (ojal\u00e1 los dos...) antes de ese turno.\r\n\r\nTambi\u00e9n, girarte a Alter Ego cuando est\u00e1s en forma Denso, aumenta tu REC a 5 (7 si tienes **[Tomarse un Respiro](/card/05033)** abajo), con la desventaja de una mano de 5 cartas en Alter Ego (la curva de costo de este mazo es tan baja, que esto no es terrible), por lo que lo m\u00e1s probable es que s\u00f3lo necesites un turno en Alter Ego para volver a tu vida completa. Despu\u00e9s, prep\u00e1rate para interceptar, interceptar e interceptar en el siguiente turno (quiz\u00e1s es sensato guardar un **[Conrol de la Densidad](/card/26007)** si es posible y \"pescar\" un **[Pasar a Trav\u00e9s](/card/26010)** o guardar un **[Rayo Solar](/card/26008)** para interceptar en el siguiente turno.\r\n\r\n**Haciendo Da\u00f1o**\r\n\r\nSaber cuando hacer el \"rush\" es una de las habilidades de elite en Marvel Champions. En el caso de Vision (y tambi\u00e9n por ejemplo en Phoenix), convertir tu h\u00e9roe de uno que intercepta a uno que ataca lo hace tan divertido de jugar. He jugado con este mazo en conjunto a otro h\u00e9roe que se encarga del ataque y siempre termino finalizando las partidas con Vision haciendo 15 de da\u00f1o aproximadamente y matando al Villano. La forma de hacer esto es la misma que expliqu\u00e9 en la secci\u00f3n anterior, cambiar de forma, sacar los eventos de la pila de descartes y ojal\u00e1 contar con Vivian en el tablero.\r\n\r\n**Resto del Mazo**\r\n\r\nLa \u00fanica carta de Vision que probablemente no uses mucho (o nada...) es **[Aumento de Masa](/card/26012)**, ya que casi siempre o finalizar\u00e1s la partida o estar\u00e1s en Alter Ego al estar en forma Denso.\r\n\r\nDel resto de las cartas del mazo, **[Disrupci\u00f3n de Fase](/card/26011)** es s\u00faper \u00fatil, pero situacional, te va a permitir Confundir al Villano (lo que ayudar\u00e1 cuando tengas que ir a Alter Ego) y descartar una Mejora del Villano, **[616 de la Calle Hickory Branch](/card/26004)** es muy buena para poner en juego a Vivian, pero est\u00e1s tan poco en Alter Ego que tambi\u00e9n es situacional y finalmente siempre es \u00fatil tener un **[Quintransporte](/card/08023)** abajo, lo que hace que este mazo tan barato, sea a\u00fan m\u00e1s eficiente. De hecho, estoy pensando en cortar los 3 recursos dobles, pero eso es para otra versi\u00f3n del mazo, no para ahora.\r\n\r\n**Obligaci\u00f3n y Archienemigo**\r\n\r\nSi, la **[Obligaci\u00f3n](/card/26028)** es un problema, ya que te obligar\u00e1 a pasar un turno en Alter Ego inmediatamente, sin poder prepararte. Cuando sale y est\u00e1s rodeado por Esbirros, yo dir\u00eda que puede ser el Tal\u00f3n de Aquiles de este mazo. Lo bueno, es que es f\u00e1cil y r\u00e1pido de lidiar y se va para siempre.\r\n\r\n**[Ultron](/card/26029)** es muy peligroso tambi\u00e9n, ya que su **[Plan](/card/26030)** pone en juego el Ambiente **[Drones de Ultr\u00f3n](/card/26031)**, lo que hace que cada ataque de Ultron, aun cu\u00e1ndo no te haga recibir da\u00f1o, te va a quitar una carta de tu mazo y pondr\u00e1 otro Esbirro contra ti. Esto hace que matar a Ultron sea la primera priordad cuando salga.Ojo, que si tienes **[Intr\u00e9pido](/card/16016)** activo, vas a matar a todos los Esbirros Drones gratis si te mantienes en Intangible.\r\n\r\n**Jugando Sin Otros H\u00e9roes**\r\n\r\nComo dije, este mazo est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado para jugar en multijugador y brilla como el controlador de la amenaza del tablero, en pareja con otro h\u00e9roe que se encargue de hacer da\u00f1o. Por lo que si est\u00e1s jugando realmente s\u00f3lo, necesitar\u00e1s ayuda y modificar un poco el mazo.\r\n\r\n**[Nova](/card/05012)** tiene que estar en el mazo para jugar s\u00f3lo. Va a ayudarte un mont\u00f3n haciendo da\u00f1o y con muchos recursos **<span class=\"icon-energy\"></span>** va a hacer mucho da\u00f1o a los Esbirros por lo que mantenerlo en el tablero es muy positivo. **[Luke Cage](/card/01076)** es caro, pero hace mucho da\u00f1o. **[Protectora](/card/26014)** tambi\u00e9n es muy \u00fatil, ya que si la emparejas con uno de tus generadores de recursos, va a tener ATQ 3 y s\u00f3lo 1 da\u00f1o consecuencial, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n es un buen target para **[Reinicio](/card/26024)**. Creo que eso es lo m\u00e1s que podr\u00edas agregar, ya que ninguno de los eventos son compatibles con Intangible. Los que saldr\u00edan del mazo, ser\u00edan **[Yocasta](/card/26013)**, **[Victor Mancha](/card/26015)** and **[Ironheart](/card/13018)**.\r\n\r\nPodr\u00eda ser interesante revisar otras cartas

bunch of Guardian outlaws to me!_\r\n<hr>\r\n**Sick of Star-Lord turning his allies into Guardians? Then it's time to pull an Uno Reverse card and instead have your allies turn your hero into a Guardian!** \r\n\r\n**_And then we give [Gamora](/card/19020) an [Energy Spear](/card/22032) and heal her forever._**\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThrough the power of [Touched](/card/38002), Rogue can tap into the crazy potential of [Gamora](/card/19020) and [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) with [Energy Spear](/card/22032)s. And, through the power of [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009), you have the potential to use [First Aid](/card/01086) SIX times per deck pass to keep them alive forever!\r\n\r\nNow, putting [Touched](/card/38002) on an ally means that [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008) won't work and that many of your events miss out on their most powerful effect. So what does that actually mean? It means that we have to be getting HUGE value from our allies when we put [Touched](/card/38002) on them to outweigh these lost opportunities. And so we have:\r\n\r\n**[Gamora](/card/19020) + [Energy Spear](/card/22032) + [Sidearm](/card/23035) + [Boot Camp](/card/13016) = 6 ATK + 1 card draw per use.**\r\n\r\n**[Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) + [Energy Spear](/card/22032) + [Sidearm](/card/23035) + [Boot Camp](/card/13016) = 8 ATK with overkill (on minions) per use.**\r\n\r\nNow, [First Aid](/card/01086) is just 2 hp from one perspective - but from most allies' perspective? 2 more hp means you can get two more uses from them! \r\n\r\n**[First Aid](/card/01086) giving either ally two more uses? = 16 damage OR 12 damage and 2 card draw!**\r\n\r\n12 damage + 2 card draw? 16 damage? For a 1-cost card?! Now that's HUGE value. And so in using [Touched](/card/38002) to set this up, both to play our allies and heal them? We're effectively exceeding the value of Rogue's own cards. Even before you've fully upgraded an ally, they are still very efficient. And most of all? It's _fun_!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n_Note: [Honorary X-Men](/card/33035) and [X-Mansion](/card/32049) are great at healing too, but it's just two hoops too many to jump through on top of playing [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) and [Gamora](/card/19020) in the first place._\r\n\r\n_Note: If you're wondering why I've not included the other Guardian toys, I've addressed them each in a later section!_\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Early Game: **\r\n<hr>\r\n> ###### **Rocket:** \"Welcome to the Guardians of the frickin' Galaxy!\" Only he didn't use _\"frickin'_.\"\r\n\r\nYour mulligan priorities are: any of your resource generators and your unrestricted Guardian allies. [X-Gene](/card/38019), [The X-Jet](/card/32020), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), and [Deft Focus](/card/16024). [Bug](/card/16040), [Cosmo](/card/17020), [Marvel Boy](/card/21041), and [Throg](/card/25014).\r\n\r\nRogue sometimes struggles to manage the high cost of her events and play anything else on the side - resource generators really open this up and it's essential to try and get 1-2 out early. With just one resource generator out, you can play [Southern Cross](/card/38006) and [First Aid](/card/01086).\r\n\r\nAnd [Bug](/card/16040) and [Cosmo](/card/17020) are the best Guardians to open the way to playing either or both of [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) and [Gamora](/card/19020), but any 2-cost Guardian is great!\r\n\r\nYou can also play [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020) on Turn #1, but it requires drawing one of them, a double resource, and either [Bug](/card/16040), [Cosmo](/card/17020), or [Marvel Boy](/card/21041). Which is highly unlikely - but potentially worth it if the stars align.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a resource generator and Guardian ally in play, the aim of the game is to maintain as much control as you can until either [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020) arrives. They are high-priority, and once you play them? The game opens up massively and starts to swing in your favour.\r\n\r\nThere are four Guardian allies in the deck that do not require the Guardian trait to play them - it's important to get one in play and keep it in play until you find either of your two key allies. Simply use [Touched](/card/38002) on any of them to play [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020)!\r\n\r\n[Bug](/card/16040) is the third-most important ally overall. While [Gambit](/card/38003) is also good and definitely the fourth-most important ally, we are building to use [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) on one of our basic allies which lowers his value of letting us grab our own hero events.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Mid Game**\r\n<hr>\r\n> ###### **Gamora:** \u201cWe\u2019re just like Kevin Bacon!\u201d \r\n\r\nThe general gameplan is to aim to achieve a board state where you have 3-4 resource generators out (potentially including [Gamora](/card/19020)) and two of [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019), [Gamora](/card/19020) and [Bug](/card/16040) out with at least an [Energy Spear](/card/22032) each. With that said, it's _very_ possible to win with only one upgraded ally and 1-2 resource generators.\r\n\r\nYour upgraded allies should take care of most of the damage you need, but Rogue herself can make a big impact between her basic ATK and her various events. \r\n\r\nNote that, while Rocket is great for damage, if there's no minion out or if there's a particularly problematic side scheme? There's no harm in him thwarting for 2! You can also use [Gambit](/card/38003) for the same effect. But usually [War Room](/card/37030), 3x [Goin' Rogue](/card/38005), [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004) and [Professor X](/card/32019) do all the heavy lifting when it comes threat removal in solo play.\r\n\r\nIf you draw [First Aid](/card/01086)? Then [Touched](/card/38002) can often just go on the villain, letting you unleash stuns, confuse, and later use [Bulletproof Belle](/card/38008). Likewise, [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) is an incredible card you can use after first putting [Touched](/card/38002) on a non-villain character, benefiting from that placement, and then use it to move it to the villain.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that, just because you are often using [Touched](/card/38002) on ally, it doesn't mean you have to miss out on all the status effects that her events can dish out!\r\n\r\nIf you end up with too many [First Aid](/card/01086)s for your ally-healing needs and no better way to spend it? Play it anyway. Heal yourself or another player/their ally. It's not _that_ efficient when used to heal a hero, but it's also pretty handy! Healing while in hero form can add a lot of flexibility and there are few cards in the game that do so unconditionally like this.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, [Plan B](/card/27024) is excellent for Rogue. Not only is it convenient disposal for any excess cards you might have in hand after playing her big events, but you can feed it the treachery card from her nemesis set (Misled) that enters your hand!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The End Game:**\r\n<hr>\r\n> ###### **Rocket:** \"That's for if things get _really_ hardcore. Or if you wanna _blow up moons_.\"  \r\n> ###### **Gamora:** \"No one's blowing up moons.\"  \r\n> ###### **Rocket:** \"...You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.\"  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to ending the game, this deck doesn't have one incredibly high-damage combo in its pocket to obliterate the enemy. Instead, it overwhelms with incredible tempo.\r\n\r\nOnce you have reached the point of 3-4 resource generators and 1-2 upgraded allies? The game should largely take care of itself. You can deal devastating damage, remove buckets of threat, and Rogue is naturally very tanky with high survivability. Control the board and feed the excess resources and ally-uses into the villain's face as damage.\r\n\r\nThen you win.\r\n\r\n_However_, with just three resource generators in play or two with a double resource in hand, you can play 2x [Southern Cross](/card/38006) on one turn. You can even keep one in hand when your turn ends to try and fish for another if the board is well-controlled but you know the villain's final form is deadly.\r\n\r\nIf you put [Touched](/card/38002) on an ally, you can deal 16 damage with 2x [Southern Cross](/card/38006)! And ideally you'll have an ally or two with 4+ ATK along with Rogue herself! In solo play, using your allies and Rogue alongside 2x [Southern Cross](/card/38006) will end most villain's final stages in one go - even on Expert.\r\n\r\nIf [Gambit](/card/38003) is out, it's those times near the end of the game that [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) really shines on him here to get you those [Southern Cross](/card/38006)es.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **The Other Guardian Cards?**\r\n<hr>\r\nRogue gives up a lot by focusing on trait-specific cards - so if they're not reliably giving you as lot of value? They are generally not worth keeping. **Read on if you want to see the reasoning on why I didn't include each, else skip this section!** \r\n\r\nI originally included all of the Guardian cards, and multiple games were going by where I would barely play them or I would play them and wouldn't get value from them. Simply put, they were very inconsistent or completely unnecessary.  \r\n\r\n- [Knowhere](/card/17022) seems like an auto-include in a deck focused on Guardian allies, right? But when the deck is about keeping said allies alive, you're not playing that many of them. A [Knowhere](/card/17022) on Turn #1 is great, but once any two of [Bug](/card/16040), [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020) are in play? A mid-to-late game [Knowhere](/card/17022) isn't getting you much value at all.\r\n\r\n- CITT seems great in combination with [Rogue's Jacket](/card/38004), but trying to play it and other stat boosts alongside the rest of the Aggression Guardians' kit is just too much setup for not enough gain. If you were focused heavily on your ATK stat, then maybe, but otherwise it's my opinion that [Plan B](/card/27024) generally outclasses it.\r\n\r\n- [Booster Boots](/card/16052) is a good card in a deck where you don't want to block with allies - but on a hero with with so many stuns, confuses, and tough cards (that are used despite it often touching an ally), it will only occasionally be useful. Worse is that it comes with the risk of discarding [Gamora](/card/19020) or [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019)! And that can really shut down your plans.\r\n\r\n- [Honorary Guardian](/card/22035) was great when I had more of the above cards in play. After trying and removing each of them? [Honorary Guardian](/card/22035) only serves to make it slightly easier to play [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) or [Gamora](/card/19020). But since [Touched](/card/38002) already makes that easy, it was just not worth keeping.\r\n\r\n- [Angela](/card/18011) can be good, but she is something of a \"_win more_\" card in my opinion. She's great if you're already ahead and set up, but bad if you're behind and struggling. If you already have two minions out, a nasty side scheme, and you're low hp? You are not playing Angela and creating another problem for yourself. If you are already setup with no trouble in sight and [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) is bored? You are probably winning anyway. There are exceptions, and she gets better in scenarios with weak minions and should likely be included there anyway, but against tougher scenarios she just wasn't ever hitting the table.\r\n\r\n- [Groot](/card/16047) and [Drax](/card/18019) are both good allies in very different ways, but Rogue doesn't need the defense and [Energy Spear](/card/22032) already turns allies like [Bug](/card/16040) and [Gamora](/card/19020) into villain slayers.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n#### **Alternative Cards:**\r\n<hr>\r\nIn addition to experimenting with some of the additional Guardian cards featured in the previous section, there are some other cards with great potential with Rogue and may better suit your playstyle or make great substitutions for cards you don't own:\r\n\r\n- [Angel](/card/33019) - He's 2-cost for Rogue, can deal 4 damage and then block. That's great value. More importantly? He is a basic ally and has Aerial. This means we can put [Touched](/card/38002) on him, use [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009) to draw [First Aid](/card/01086), then move [Touched](/card/38002) with [Energy Transfer](/card/38007) and retain his Aerial trait to power up our other events.\r\n\r\n- [Vivian](/card/26003) - Much like Angel, she is another Aerial hero who can help us fetch [First Aid](/card/01086) while also having an incredibly useful response!\r\n\r\n- [Assess the Situation](/card/12033) - Much like the Storm hero, Rogue likes cheap cards to play around her expensive events. And nothing gets cheaper than a 0-cost card. Play this to bank an awkward resource and regain it on the next turn as another card. Digging through our deck faster with it also helps us find our best cards sooner.\r\n\r\n- [Beauty and the Thief](/card/37019) - If [Gambit](/card/38003) is in play? This card is one of the best. The issue is that Gambit is not always reliably out and, if playing solo, there is not always 4 threat to remove. Sometimes, unless the villain has schemed, there is only 1. And this, combined with a hero who has tons of threat removal, can often just make it unnecessary. With that said? Definitely include this if in multiplayer with Gambit.\r\n\r\n- [Skilled Strike](/card/09037) - So you've got out [Bug](/card/16040) or [Throg](/card/25014) but your other allies are hiding. What do you do with [Superpower Adaptation](/card/38009)? Ideally, you pitch it to play a different card. But, if you can't, then you need an Aggression event to find with it. I originally ran this deck with 2x [Skilled Strike](/card/09037) and, while I didn't use it much, it's certainly a nice cheap option to have if you want one.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n**Good luck and have fun!**\r\n<hr>", "user_id": 16053, "investigator_code": "38001a", "investigator_name": "Rogue", "slots": {"01086": 3, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01092": 1, "13016": 1, "16019": 1, "16024": 1, "16040": 1, "17020": 1, "19020": 1, "21041": 1, "22032": 3, "23035": 1, "25014": 1, "27024": 1, "32019": 1, "32020": 1, "37030": 1, "38002": 1, "38003": 1, "38004": 1, "38005": 3, "38006": 3, "38007": 2, "38008": 2, "38009": 3, "38019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26700, "name": "Guille Liderando Fenix", "date_creation": "2023-03-08T12:41:12+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-08T12:41:12+00:00", "description_md": "liderando XMen con la fuerza Phoenix", "user_id": 16298, "investigator_code": "34001a", "investigator_name": "Phoenix", "slots": {"01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "04016": 1, "05023": 1, "12024": 1, "32019": 1, "32049": 1, "33011": 1, "33015": 2, "33018": 2, "33019": 1, "33020": 1, "34002a": 1, "34003": 1, "34004": 1, "34005": 1, "34006": 1, "34007": 1, "34008": 1, "34009": 1, "34010": 2, "34011": 2, "34012": 2, "34013": 2, "34022": 1, "34034": 3, "36015": 1, "36016": 1, "36017": 1, "36018": 1, "36020": 3, "36022": 1, "38018": 1, "38019": 1, "38028": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "multiplayer"}, {"id": 26701, "name": "Captain Chema", "date_creation": "2023-03-08T13:32:37+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-08T13:32:37+00:00", "description_md": "a ver como funciona esto", "user_id": 16298, "investigator_code": "01010a", "investigator_name": "Captain Marvel", "slots": {"01011": 1, "01012": 3, "01013": 3, "01014": 2, "01015": 1, "01016": 1, "01017": 2, "01018": 2, "01060": 3, "01065": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "01092": 1, "04045": 1, "04047": 3, "05023": 1, "08012": 1, "08023": 1, "14030": 1, "15011": 1, "15013": 3, "34020": 2, "37013": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"justice\"}", "tags": "multiplayer"}, {"id": 26702, "name": "Ironheart Justice -

Priorities will be on [The Golden City](/card/01045) > [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049) > [Avengers Tower](/card/03024) > [Quincarrier](/card/08023) > [Panther Claws](/card/01047) >[Tactical Genius](/card/01048)/[Energy Daggers](/card/01046). Allies are lower on the priority scale (except [Shuri](/card/01041) to fetch an upgrade and [Maria Hill](/card/01067) to help everyone develop) so don't be afraid to use them as resources.\r\n\r\nMidgame:\r\nAfter you've assembled most of your suits and supports, it's time to shift priorities to developing allies. You don't have to wait on using [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017). Drawing 2 cards is the goal and anything more is a bonus. You should also be using all of your [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043d).\r\n\r\nEndgame:\r\nThe endgame state is when you're able to keep 4+ allies on the field and drawing 4+ cards with [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) and playing multiple [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) each turn.\r\n\r\nCard choices:\r\n\r\n[Kaluu](/card/21014): the perfect card for this deck. Finds [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) and [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a). Can then defend and recycled with [Make the Call](/card/01071) on the next turn.\r\n\r\n[Maria Hill](/card/01067): very good at helping development during early and midgame where not being an Avenger doesn't matter for [Avengers Tower](/card/03024).\r\n\r\n[Captain America](/card/21011): should cost 2 or less (3+ Avenger allies + T'challa) most of the time and he's just good value at that price. His play pattern also lines up nicely with [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) (e.g. exhaust to draw, ready, defend an attack with Toughness).\r\n\r\n[Team Training](/card/04016): this lets you play [Ant-Man](/card/12011) for 0 cost and also use [Make the Call](/card/01071) on him. Overall also useful to get another activation out of your allies whenever you're not exhausting them to draw.\r\n\r\n[Mighty Avengers](/card/21015): this is more of a midgame card that doubles the effectiveness of most of your allies on turns you're not playing [Strength In Numbers](/card/03017). \r\n\r\nCards I chose not to include:\r\n\r\n[Avengers Assemble!](/card/03015): this is only useful in very narrow circumstances after you're already fully setup anyway and for the cost of playing it, you would rather play multiple [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) and replenish your ally count. And I would rather have the cards currently in the deck than this.\r\n\r\n[Band Together](/card/21018): early game is when you really need the resources and that's when this is the most useless.",

spotlit card: [Target Practice](/card/17017).  \r\n[Target Practice](/card/17017) has the potential to be 1 Effective resource for 2 Damage.  Unfortunately the situation to get it there has a number of deck building requirements. \r\nThe cool choice is definitely combos with [Dust](/card/33012).  But Overkill is another great way to take advantage [Target Practice](/card/17017) being able to sit and wait for the prime opportunity to strike.\r\n\r\n## GAME PLAN:\r\n\r\n### Overkill\r\n\r\n[Laser Blaster](/card/17019), [Snowguard](/card/29023) & [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) give you access to overkill.  In need of good targets, well [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) is a THWART event that Gamora can play in any aspect.\r\n\r\n### Voltron\r\n\r\nWe have [Laser Blaster](/card/17019) and we are looking to buff up some Allies, well who better than [Yondu](/card/17013)?  He can hold Upgrades and attack every turn without taking consequential.  So added a few more permanent Upgrades to go with him: [Inspired](/card/01074) & [Sidearm](/card/23035).  Adding a [Leadership Skill](/card/36019) as well because it's just good for all our allies without having to be dependent on them surviving.  \r\n\r\n### Weapons\r\nWell, we now have 4 Weapons in the deck between [Sidearm](/card/23035), [Laser Blaster](/card/17019) & [Gamora's Sword](/card/18010).  We also have 3 more spots for off-aspect events.  [Fusillade](/card/20026) seems like a great fit for the deck.  None of the weapons care about being exhausted.  [Fusillade](/card/20026) packs a nice punch to soften up an enemy before a big overkill attack.\r\n\r\n### Allies\r\n\r\n[Groot](/card/16047) - [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) or a random Minion may not always line up when you want them.  Groot has a lot of HP and healing to sit and tank a Minion until we are ready to Overkill it.  Also, Groot holds [Inspired](/card/01074) pretty well for Thwarting.\r\n\r\n[Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) - Not much to say here other than he comes with 4 ATK vs Minions and gets overkill without other cards.  Also having 2 THW is pretty good.\r\n\r\n[Snowguard](/card/29023) - The most versatile option.  3 ATK and overkill is [Rocket Raccoon](/card/16019) light but her 3 ATK works on the Villian.  3 THW is great if you need the extra THW.  5 HP and Retaliate is great when [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043) or a random Minion may not always line up when you want them.\r\n\r\n[Yondu](/card/17013) - All together, [Yondu](/card/17013) can reach 5 ATK before [Target Practice](/card/17017) with [Inspired](/card/01074), [Laser Blaster](/card/17019), [Sidearm](/card/23035), & [Leadership Skill](/card/36019) activation.  [Laser Blaster](/card/17019) giving him overkill makes the case.\r\n\r\n### The Plan\r\n\r\n- Get an Ally on the board with Overkill, attach a Weapon Upgrade to said Ally, and get some amount of [Target Practice](/card/17017) on board.\r\n- Get a minion on the board via luck or [Looking for Trouble](/card/16043).\r\n- Use [Gamora](/card/18001a) basic ATK or Attack Events to soften up the Minion HP to as close to 1 as possible.\r\n- Attack Minion with Ally that has overkill.\r\n- Trigger [Target Practice](/card/17017) to either a.) Get to the HP threshold of the Minion because we couldn't soften it up enough.  b.) Do more overkill damage.\r\n- Repeat\r\n\r\n### FLEXIBLE SPOTS:\r\n\r\n[Leadership Skill](/card/36019) - Not a weapon.\r\n\r\n[Inspired](/card/01074) - Not a weapon.\r\n\r\n[\"Welcome Aboard\"](/card/20027) - [Gamora](/card/18001a) doesn't have the greatest economy for things that aren't Attack or Thwart.  [Yondu](/card/17013) being leadership, 4 cost, and the other Allies being basic lead to the decision to go with this as my economy. 3x may be too many for the 5 allies in the deck currently but everything else is either playable with [Keen Instincts](/card/18009) or only costs 1.\r\n\r\n### ALTERNATE CONSIDERATIONS:\r\n\r\n[Major Victory](/card/21053)/[Command Team](/card/23016)/[Get Ready](/card/01069) - There isn't a ton of room for these types of effects.  I think if I was playing multi-player these could be a consideration over some amount of allies.\r\n\r\n[Maria Hill](/card/01067)/[Ironheart](/card/13018)/[Nick Fury](/card/01084) - Card draw allies to get you through to the cards.\r\n\r\n[Strength In Numbers](/card/03017) - Not enough allies but it would help in assembling things.\r\n\r\n[The Power in All of Us](/card/13024) - If [Yondu](/card/17013) wasn't Leadership, this would be in the deck.", "user_id": 26151, "investigator_code": "18001a", "investigator_name": "Gamora", "slots": {"01074": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "16019": 1, "16043": 3, "16047": 1, "17013": 1, "17017": 3, "17019": 1, "18002": 1, "18003": 2, "18004": 2, "18005": 2, "18006": 2, "18007": 2, "18008": 1, "18009": 2, "18010": 1, "20026": 3, "20027": 3, "23035": 3, "29023": 1, "36019": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26790, "name": "Natasha Romanoff: Meditative Spy", "date_creation": "2023-03-11T15:03:19+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-11T19:09:16+00:00", "description_md": "## **Gameplan**\r\n\r\n- **Mulligan:** look for [Safe House #29](/card/08005), [Black Widow's Gauntlet](/card/08007), and [Meditation](/card/26036) primarily. If you have them already, you can fish for things to Meditate into.\r\n- **Early game:** develop [Safe House #29](/card/08005), [Black Widow's Gauntlet](/card/08007), [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), and [Beat Cop](/card/10029). Stay in alter-ego to take advantage of the virtually 7 card hand.\r\n- **Midgame:** set up to loop [Counterintelligence](/card/08017) every turn then start throwing in [Covert Ops](/card/08003) and allies to chip down the villain. \r\n- **Lategame:** set up some turns with [Attacrobatics](/card/08006) and [Grappling Hook](/card/08008) out to flip over to Widow and play [Dance of Death](/card/08004) for a burst of damage.\r\n\r\n## **Card choices:**\r\n\r\n * [Meditation](/card/26036): super efficient card for this deck since the plan is to stay in alter-ego the majority of the time and there's usually no other reason to exhaust Natasha. Ideally used for [Beat Cop](/card/10029), [Helicarrier](/card/01092), [Covert Ops](/card/08003), and allies. Its main downside is it's only usable once per turn so it can get awkward if you draw multiple on the same turn. But it's a strong enough card to hold onto an extra copy to use the next turn.\r\n * [Beat Cop](/card/10029): consistent threat control and works well with [Meditation](/card/26036).\r\n * [Helicarrier](/card/01092): playing this over [Quincarrier](/card/08023) b/c Quincarrier requires you to be an Avenger and won't work with [Meditation](/card/26036).\r\n * [Counterintelligence](/card/08017): this is the primary card to get with [Agent Coulson](/card/08011). With [Safe House #29](/card/08005) + 2 [Black Widow's Gauntlet](/card/08007)/[Helicarrier](/card/01092), you're preventing 3 threat (and drawing a card) every turn.\r\n * [Spycraft](/card/08018): this is mostly to get rid of a really really bad encounter ([Shadow of the Past](/card/01190) or any giant minions) but otherwise you just sit on it for insurance.\r\n * [Espionage](/card/08033): is a 1-cost Preparation (so useful for Mission Prep and [Winter Soldier](/card/08002)) that can potentially get you 2 cards (cost neutral) at some point in the future. \r\n * [Quake](/card/08012): you'll be in alter-ego most of the time so she's a consistent source of minion damage.\r\n * [Snowguard](/card/29023): 9 dmg for 5 effective cost (1.8 dmg per cost). With [Meditation](/card/26036) it becomes 9 dmg for 3 ec which is really good. I think she's better than [Daredevil](/card/01058) because she's more streamlined in what this deck needs (more damage).\r\n * [Determination](/card/21052): \"free\" threat removal (technically 1 effective cost but it's getting used to pay for another card anyway so the bonus is basically free). There are 11 1-cost cards so it lines up nicely with this.\r\n\r\n### **Cards not included:**\r\n\r\n * [Foiled!](/card/09038): the timing of this means you'll be down a card for the turns that you play it so even though it's printed as a 0 cost, it's effectively a 2 cost card for preventing 2 threat on average.\r\n * [Multitasking](/card/15013)/[Clear the Area](/card/04049)/[Skilled Investigator](/card/04047)/etc: the majority of the cards commonly played require you to be in Hero mode which you actively want to avoid.\r\n * [Turn the Tide](/card/15015): would only work with [Covert Ops](/card/08003) or her natural thwarting making it not reliable at all.\r\n\r\n### **Strengths**\r\n\r\n- Efficient threat control. Once set up, you're able to remove/prevent 6+ threat every turn.\r\n- Drawing lots of cards. Staying in Alter-ego will let you have a consistent 7 card hand.\r\n- Good resource management. Meditation + a lot of 1-cost cards + 7 card hand means there won't be many awkward turns where you're doing nothing.\r\n\r\n### **Weaknesses**\r\n\r\n- Low damage output. It will take a while to finish games.\r\n- Not very good minion control.

And Justice For Thor", "date_creation": "2023-03-11T17:31:34+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-15T16:21:19+00:00", "description_md": "Thor's Have at Thee ability is once per phase, not per turn. I was looking for ways to trigger it during the Villain phase - enter S.H.I.E.L.D. support! With [Global Logistics](/card/27043) you can ensure that you see a minion quite consistently. With so many draws it allows you to _Load_ your hand and really fix-up Thor's economy. I was surprised that there were no Thor decks on here that include [Global Logistics](/card/27043).\r\n\r\nThe other advantage is that Justice makes up for Thor's lack of thwart. Adding [Surveillance Team](/card/01064), [Clear the Area](/card/04049) and a few allies round it out nicely.\r\n\r\nEarly on you want to get out a few resource generators, try to mulligan for at least one. Staying or switching back to alter-ego in the first few turns can be useful as you can get an extra card by spending [Mjolnir](/card/06009) and returning it with the Worthy ability. \r\n\r\nThe general strategy is to then draw out minions and side schemes without getting overwhelmed. Be careful to see how much thwart or attack you have to see what you can deal with. Later on you will have enough resources to _Ride the Lightning_ with [Hammer Throw](/card/06005) and [Lightning Strike](/card/06006). As Thor has 14 health you can sometimes afford to leave a minion out for an extra turn if you can't defeat it straight away, but eventually you will want to _Kill 'Em All_. \r\n\r\nYou have some very satisfying turns, such as starting with [_One_ Way or Another](/card/30017) to fetch a secondary scheme, [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) to defeat it, followed by [Turn the Tide](/card/15015) on the minion you just put into play.\r\n\r\nIt can be tricky to have the resources to finish off minions at times with Thor's cards, especially early on. You have cheap damage from your 3 attack stat (with [Mjolnir](/card/06009)) and [Limitless Stamina](/card/31023), or [Turn the Tide](/card/15015), which is ideal in this deck. [Sky-Destroyer](/card/27055) is a consistent source of damage here that helps weaken higher health minions.\r\n\r\nNote that for [Turn the Tide](/card/15015) it has to be the Thor that removes the threat - so make sure to use [Surveillance Team](/card/01064) first and [Clear the Area](/card/04049) or [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) last when clearing schemes.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the intro, [Global Logistics](/card/27043) is mostly used to ensure you will get a minion from an encounter card. In solo you can sometimes stack a minion for the next 2 turns with 1 use (if there is no surge or extra cards). It also allows you to avoid some of the worst treachery cards and know what will happen the next turn. This can allow you to safely switch into alter-ego for a turn to recover. Another nice part is that [Loki](/card/06028) becomes easier to deal with as you can ensure he will not discard a treachery.\r\n\r\n[Blindfold](/card/33014) can help with finding minions, especially when combined with [Cosmo](/card/17020). You just have to discard the appropriate number of cards before the minion to ensure you get it as an encounter rather than a boost. \r\n\r\nOf course when stacking the encounter deck you want to then avoid disturbing it - so make sure to use [One Way or Another](/card/22015) and [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003) first. Keep a check on the number of cards in your deck too, to know when the extra encounter card will be taken. Also make a note of how many minions and side schemes there are in the scenario. It is good to keep track of how many are left in the encounter deck so that you don't waste a card with [One Way or Another](/card/22015) or [Defender of the Nine Realms](/card/06003). It helps to know which side schemes are still left, as there are some you may want to avoid. \r\n\r\n[Helicarrier](/card/01092) is here because it helps with the S.H.I.E.L.D. support, in particular [Agent 13](/card/03002) who can ready it for another use. \r\n\r\nIt is 44 cards, but I could not see anything to take out. You draw through the deck quickly enough anyway. This deck is mostly aimed at solo play, but should be ok in 2-player too. For 3 and 4 player games it won't work as there will be 3/4 boost cards first, so [Global Logistics](/card/27043) cannot let you choose which encounter card you receive. \r\n\r\nI did consider removing [Agent Coulson](/card/08011) and [Counterintelligence](/card/08017), as early on it is difficult to have enough resources to play both the same turn. However, both cards are good individually - [Agent Coulson](/card/08011) is cheap if you consider the 1-card refund after playing him and [Counterintelligence](/card/08017) helps to safely go to alter-ego. I prefer that than confuse here: Given the space issues I would only be able to fit in one or two cards that confuse, which is then not very reliable against anything with Stalwart.

Quantumania (Team-Up)](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/26807/recur-inspire-quantumania-team-up-1.0)\r\n\r\n- If playing both decks, remove [Quincarrier](/card/08023) for another [Quick Strike](/card/25018) or another lower-cost ally for [Earth's Mightiest Heroes](/card/04022) like [Valkyrie](/card/06012).\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://images.thedirect.com/media/article_full/ant-man-quantumania-spoilers.jpg\"width=\"400\" height=\"200\">\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\n\r\n### **_Max ATK:_**\r\n\r\n- Utilize [Giant Strength](/card/12009) x2 when you flip to Giant-form to increase your strength by 2.\r\n\r\n- [Fluid Motion](/card/28016) combines with low-cost events aided by [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) to increase  your strength by another 2-4. ([Surprise Attack](/card/13014) is 0 cost when using [Martial Prowess](/card/10018) and Ant-Man is easy to flip.\r\n\r\n- [Combat Training](/card/01057) adds another +1 ATK.\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\n### **_Ideal Play:_**\r\n\r\n- With [Resize](/card/12005) and/or [Swarm Tactics](/card/12020) you'd like to flip from Tiny-form to Giant-form twice for +4 ATK, while playing as many low-cost (attack) events as you can, e.g. [Surprise Attack](/card/13014) or [Quick Strike](/card/25018).\r\n\r\n- You'll trigger [Fluid Motion](/card/28016) with those low-cost events for another +2 ATK.\r\n\r\n- With [Combat Training](/card/01057) down, you'll have around +7 ATK (10 ATK total). Your [Quick Strike](/card/25018) will have hit pretty hard with that increased attack.\r\n\r\n- Finally, with low-cost allies down you'll be able to then basic attack for 10 damage, and hopefully have a [Earth's Mightiest Heroes](/card/04022) in hand to swing again for another 10 damage or so.\r\n\r\n- [Swarm Tactics](/card/12020) and [Ready to Rumble](/card/21022) will also hopefully have contributed to another swing for you near that max damage.\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\n### **_Theme!:_**\r\n\r\n- In the spirit of Quantumania, you'll have two ally Wasp targets for [Swarm Tactics](/card/12020) when playing solo.

Action to constantly recur both allies and events that then heal and ready those allies. You'll flip to alter-ego and choose what card you need for that moment to recur._\r\n\r\n- _You'll use specific allies and events that all combo with each other and will all be able to be recurred using Wasp's alter-ego action._\r\n\r\n________\r\n\r\n- **Multiplayer:** This deck is especially thematic with multiplayer in mind for my Quantumania Ant-Man deck: [Fluid Attack Ant-Man - Quantumania (Team-Up)](https://marvelcdb.com/decklist/view/26807/recur-inspire-quantumania-team-up-1.0)\r\n\r\n- If playing both decks, remove [Quincarrier](/card/08023) from Ant-Man for another [Quick Strike](/card/25018) or another lower-cost ally for [Earth's Mightiest Heroes](/card/04022) like [Valkyrie](/card/06012).\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.murphysmultiverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AMTW_Q.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&ssl=1\"width=\"400\" height=\"200\">\r\n_________\r\n \r\n### **_Recursion:_**\r\n\r\n- Allies: [Squirrel Girl](/card/03013), [Black Panther](/card/01040a), Power Man, [Goliath](/card/04013), Ant-Man, and U.S. Agent will all be able to be recurred.\r\n\r\n-  Events: [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) and [First Aid](/card/01086) will be recurred so that you can heal those allies and ready them.\r\n_________\r\n\r\n### **_Allies:_**\r\n\r\n- [Giant-Man](/card/12012) although not a <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> is great in this deck, not to mention a great thematic addition. Hank Pym was actually the original Giant-Man! This ally is also quite effective in this deck in that you'll always be able to swing for 4-5 ATK. Late game this is an ideal target for [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) and [Reinforced Suit](/card/12018). (Check out the art on the suit!). [Teamwork](/card/06032) is another card that ensures your max attack by artificially increasing his health.\r\n\r\n- [Goliath](/card/04013) is another hero whose moniker was originally Hank Pym. You'll also get the most out of his ability with multiple attacks of 5-6 ATK with [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030). Wait for the right time to use his action, he's actually an excellent thwarter, especially with [Mighty Avengers](/card/21015) down.\r\n\r\n- Power-Man is yet another <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> recursion target that's also an ideal target for [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) to get the most out of his action of increased ATK in a phase.\r\n\r\n- [Black Panther](/card/01040a) is a recursion target that can also get you [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) when you haven't yet drawn it or recurred it.\r\n\r\n- U.S. Agent actually is not a bad target for [First Aid](/card/01086) or [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) when you have [Mighty Avengers](/card/21015) down. He'll usually be able to soak up at least one hit or two from the villain for you. Also, don't be afraid to experiment and sub a card for [Ready for Action](/card/04017), which is a <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span> you'll be able to recur.\r\n\r\n- You'll be able to get multiple allies out with [Stinger](/card/12014), [Avengers Tower](/card/03024), and [The Triskelion](/card/01073).\r\n_____\r\n\r\n### **_Events:_**\r\n\r\n- [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) is the main ready/heal you're going to be recurring with Wasp's AE-action. Once you have an ally like [Giant-Man](/card/12012), [Goliath](/card/04013), or Power-Man down you'll have some great high-attack turns. [Giant-Man](/card/12012) is your best target, and essentially once you draw one of these, you know you're doing at least 10 damage that turn.\r\n\r\n- [First Aid](/card/01086) is a card you'll use if you just have been unlucky drawing into or recurring your [Inspiring Presence](/card/10030) on [Giant-Man](/card/12012). I use [Goliath](/card/23015) to thwart early and he's also an excellent target. U.S. Agent can take multiple hits with this card as well. Don't forget you can use this in alter-ego form.\r\n\r\n- [Ready for Action](/card/04017) has been in this deck and I do really love it for this deck with it being a <span class=\"icon-mental\"></span>. Especially for U.S. Agent, so you keep blocking the villain. Feel free to sub a card and see how you like it.\r\n_________\r\n\r\n### **_Theme!:_**\r\n\r\n- In the spirit of Quantumania, I've tested this deck extensively, especially with Kang Expert and the MODOK modular with smooth sailing.\r\n\r\n- So much theme with [Giant-Man](/card/12012), [Goliath](/card/04013), [Stinger](/card/12014), and [Reinforced Suit](/card/12018)!\r\n_________\r\n\r\n_**I've had a ton of fun with this deck. I love once you're set up,  you have a specific tactic in mind and a recursion mechanic I've always been fond of. You can essentially almost recur you're entire deck and pick the card you need for the right situation. Hope you have fun with this deck if you choose to give it a try!**_\r\n_________\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/listing_xM7CEav.jpg/BROK/resize/1200x1200%3E/format/jpg/quality/70/listing_xM7CEav.jpg\"width=\"400\" height=\"200\">", "user_id": 2326, "investigator_code": "13001a", "investigator_name": "Wasp", "slots": {"01072": 2, "01073": 1, "01086": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 1, "03013": 1, "03024": 1, "04013": 1, "04014": 1, "04016": 1, "08023": 1, "10030": 2, "12011": 1, "12012": 1, "12014": 1, "12018": 1, "13002": 1, "13003": 2, "13004": 3, "13005": 2, "13006": 2, "13007": 2, "13008": 1, "13009": 1, "13010": 1, "13020": 1, "21012": 1, "21015": 1, "23012": 1, "29027": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": "solo, multiplayer, theme"}, {"id": 26808, "name": "Thor", "date_creation": "2023-03-12T02:14:35+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-12T02:14:35+00:00", "description_md": "asdfasdfasdfasdfadfadfasdf", "user_id": 697, "investigator_code": "06001a", "investigator_name": "Thor", "slots": {"01050": 1, "01051": 1, "01053": 2, "01055": 2, "01057": 3, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 3, "05030": 3, "06002": 1, "06003": 3, "06004": 1, "06005": 3, "06006": 2, "06007": 1, "06008": 2, "06009": 1, "06010": 1, "06011": 1, "06012": 1, "06014": 2, "06015": 2, "06017": 1, "06018": 3, "06019": 1, "06020": 1}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "2.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"aggression\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26809, "name": "Spider-Man", "date_creation": "2023-03-12T02:18:14+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-12T02:18:14+00:00", "description_md": "dsfadsfadfasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "user_id": 697, "investigator_code": "01001a", "investigator_name": "Spider-Man", "slots": {"01002": 1, "01003": 2, "01004": 2, "01005": 3, "01006": 1, "01007": 2, "01008": 2, "01009": 2, "01075": 1, "01076": 1, "01077": 2, "01078": 2, "01079": 1, "01080": 2, "01081": 2, "01082": 2, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 3, "03033": 2, "05012": 1, "05014": 2, "05015": 2, "05017": 2, "06033": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"protection\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26810, "name": "Captain America", "date_creation": "2023-03-12T02:21:58+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-12T02:21:58+00:00", "description_md": "asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasd", "user_id": 697, "investigator_code": "03001a", "investigator_name": "Captain America", "slots": {"01066": 1, "01067": 1, "01068": 1, "01069": 2, "01070": 2, "01071": 2, "01072": 2, "01074": 1, "01084": 1, "01088": 1, "01089": 1, "01090": 1, "01091": 3, "03002": 1, "03003": 2, "03004": 3, "03005": 2, "03006": 2, "03007": 1, "03008": 1, "03009": 1, "03010": 2, "03011": 1, "03013": 1, "03014": 1, "03015": 2, "03017": 2, "05032": 2, "06032": 2}, "ignoreDeckLimitSlots": null, "version": "1.0", "meta": "{\"aspect\":\"leadership\"}", "tags": ""}, {"id": 26811, "name": "Multiplayer Support Spider-Man", "date_creation": "2023-03-12T02:23:45+00:00", "date_update": "2023-03-12T02:31:20+00:00", "description_md": "Check if someone else is using [Quincarrier](/card/08023) or not.

Deck niby podobny do poprzedniego Thora, ale w praktyce zupe\u0142nie inny, jako \u017ce T'Challa jest zupe\u0142nie inn\u0105 postaci\u0105. Thor mia\u0142 du\u017co problemu z zasobami, ma\u0142\u0105 r\u0119k\u0119 startow\u0105, powoli si\u0119 rozkr\u0119ca\u0142 itp. Czarna pantera jest jego przeciwie\u0144stwem - mamy a\u017c 8 podw\u00f3jnych zasob\u00f3w dzi\u0119ki dodatkowym [Vibranium](/card/01044). W dodatku nie mamy takich problem\u00f3w z schemami dzi\u0119ki bazowym 2 Thw wspomaganym z [Tactical Genius](/card/01048). No i leczenie z [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049). To wszystko sprawia, \u017ce mo\u017cemy sobie pozwali\u0107 na du\u017co bardziej wolny i kontrolny styl gry ni\u017c w przypadku Thora.\r\n\r\n- Z nowych zabawek z pakietu Thora mamy przede wszystkim [Mean Swing](/card/06015) i [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019). Mean Swing jest o tyle fajny u Black Panther, \u017ce jego dwa upgrade czyli [Panther Claws](/card/01047) i [Energy Daggers](/card/01046) to \"weapon\" i to takie, kt\u00f3rych wyczerpywaniem nie musimy si\u0119 przejmowa\u0107. Jarnbjorn jest fajne, bo [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) to taki narz\u0119dzie do jego aktywacji. Dodatkowo mo\u017cemy go wyci\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 z [Shuri](/card/01041). \r\n\r\n- Z naszymi dodatkowymi zasobami mo\u017cemy by\u0107 bardziej chciwi je\u015bli chodzi o ekonomie st\u0105d [Avengers Mansion](/card/01091) i [Quincarrier](/card/08023) w decku. Nie s\u0105 to kluczowe karty, ale je\u015bli akurat si\u0105d\u0105 jak mamy podw\u00f3jne zasoby to swoje jak najbardziej robi\u0105. Dodatkowo mamy [Enhanced Physique](/card/19033) jako \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142o gwarantowanych pi\u0105stek do Jarnbjorna. Tu te\u017c uwaga - ju\u017c w nast\u0119pnym pakiecie z [Black Widow](/card/08001a) dostajemy [Quincarrier](/card/08023), wi\u0119c je\u015bli mamy go w swoim arsenale to mo\u017cemy si\u0119 pozby\u0107 Enhanced physique. \r\n\r\n- Gramy [Tac Team](/card/01056), kt\u00f3ry osobi\u015bcie ca\u0142kiem lubi\u0119 (a przynajmniej na tym etapie gry). Nie wyci\u0105gamy z niego niesamowitego value - za 3 zasoby \u0142\u0105cznie 6 obra\u017ce\u0144 roz\u0142o\u017conego na 3 tury jest dalekie do idea\u0142u. Podobne value robi\u0105 sojusznicy za 3 z agresji, a mog\u0105 pos\u0142u\u017cy\u0107 jeszcze do obrony ataku i maj\u0105 cz\u0119sto dodatkow\u0105 zdolno\u015b\u0107 jak grani przez nas [Tigra](/card/01051) czy [Valkyrie](/card/06012). To czemu to gramy? Z kilku powod\u00f3w. Przede wszystkim mamy du\u017co podw\u00f3jnych zasob\u00f3w, a w momencie gdy ju\u017c mamy nasze upgrady na stole target\u00f3w pod nie mamy mniej, wi\u0119c mo\u017cemy sobie pozwoli\u0107 na ci\u0119\u017csze rzeczy. Dwa, \u017ce tac team bardzo pasuje do naszej mechaniki, tzn. z naszym [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) ma\u0142o kiedy potrzebujemy dobi\u0107 miniona za 5, cz\u0119sciej raczej potrzebujemy co\u015b tam podobija\u0107 wi\u0119c w jego przypadku preferuje Tac team ponad takie rzeczy jak [Relentless Assault](/card/01053). Trzy fajny jest do ko\u0144czenia gierek. Zostawiamy sobie 1 zas\u00f3b na ostatni\u0105 tur\u0119, wtedy 2x aktywacja tac team, 2 sojusznik\u00f3w z 2 atk  ju\u017c dmg robi si\u0119 fajny. Tak czy siak to \u017caden priorytet na stole, dalej wi\u0119kszy maj\u0105 sojusznicy, Tac team zagrywamy po prostu jak jest okazja.\r\n\r\n- Skoro ju\u017c o sojusznikach m\u00f3wimy, to gramy ich ca\u0142kiem sporo.\r\n - Nick fury - dla mnie \"no-brainer\" w taliach w kt\u00f3rych mamy w\u0142a\u015bnie du\u017co podw\u00f3jnych zasob\u00f3w. Pozwala nam mieli\u0107 talie, czyli potencjalnie dobra\u0107 kolejne [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a)\r\n - [Hulk](/card/01050) - pami\u0119tajcie, \u017ce to jednak nie deck Thora gdzie mocno si\u0119 nastawiali\u015bmy na pi\u0105stki. Tu mamy ich znaaacznie mniej. Przez co u\u017cywanie jego aktywacji jest no... jak wszystko przy Hulku... mocno kontrowersyjne. Hulk jest bardziej do obrony. Jak wejdzie w po\u0142\u0105czeniu z [The Power of Aggression](/card/01055) to kosztuje tyle co nic, ma 5 hp, wi\u0119c ma szanse przyj\u0105\u0107 na klat\u0119 2 ataku z\u0142ola.\r\n - Wspomniany wcze\u015bniej duet w postaci [Valkyrie](/card/06012) i [Tigra](/card/01051). Tigra jest szczeg\u00f3lnie fajna w tym decku. Z [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) i [Tac Team](/card/01056) setowanie minion\u00f3w tak by Tigra zadawa\u0142a im ostatni atak jest bardzo proste, nawet jak miniony maj\u0105 po te 6 i wi\u0119cej hp.\r\n - [Lockjaw](/card/05018) nie jest taki kluczowy jak w poprzednich deckach. S\u0105 gry gdzie go nawet nie zagramy, ale zawsze czuwa w pogotowiu na wypadek gdyby\u015bmy potrzebowali te dodatkowe 2 pkt w Sch.\r\n - [Mockingbird](/card/01083) na tym etapie stalwart jeszcze nie istnieje wi\u0119c z tego korzystamy. Stuny z czarn\u0105 panter\u0105 s\u0105 o tyle fajne, \u017ce daj\u0105 nam dodatkowy czas nanadrobienie HPk\u00f3w z [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049). \r\n\r\n- Ostatnimi kartami o kt\u00f3rych nie m\u00f3wili\u015bmy s\u0105 [Endurance](/card/05023) i [Combat Training](/card/01057). Endurance jest fajne, bo mo\u017cemy przyj\u0105\u0107 dodatkowy hit z\u0142ola na klat\u0119, a potem spokojnie si\u0119 leczy\u0107 z [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049) gwarantuj\u0105c sobie z niego pe\u0142ne value. Combat training jest daleko na naszej li\u015bcie priorytet\u00f3w. Gramy Mean Swing co prawda, ale to nie jest tak, \u017ce b\u0119dziemy atakowa\u0107 co tur\u0119. Kolejna karta kt\u00f3ra jest ok do zagrania jak podpasuj\u0105 zasoby, ale nie jest niewiadomo jak wa\u017cna.\r\n\r\nI to by by\u0142o na tyle. W pilota\u017cu mam wra\u017cenie, \u017ce jest ciupk\u0119 trudniejszy od reszty omawianych deck\u00f3w, troch\u0119 dodatkowych decyzji mamy wi\u0119cej do podj\u0119cia. Zaczynaj\u0105c od wyboru upgradu na start - przewa\u017cnie zaczynam od [Tactical Genius](/card/01048) lub [Vibranium Suit](/card/01049), ale to te\u017c nie regu\u0142a, zale\u017cy mocno od scenariusza. Dodatkowo czy lepiej si\u0119 zbroi\u0107 od razu, czy wykorzysta\u0107 [Wakanda Forever!](/card/01043a) do kontroli sto\u0142u na pocz\u0105tku kosztem po\u015bwi\u0119cenia/przesuni\u0119cia na p\u00f3\u017aniej kolejnej cz\u0119\u015bci pancerza? Druga rzecz to wykorzystywanie naszego basic power. Atakowa\u0107 potrzebujemy jak mamy [Mean Swing](/card/06015) a to i dodatkowo odpalenie [Jarnbjorn](/card/06019). Sch jest fajny, bo Sch zawsze ma\u0142o w agresji. Def jest fajny, bo lepiej mo\u017cemy wykorzysta\u0107 nasze retaliate. Wi\u0119c troszk\u0119 trzeba jednak wyczu\u0107.

Oh [Shrink](/card/05011) pumps [Even the Odds](/card/30014)... Oh [Ms. Marvel](/card/05001a) can recur it to hand every turn if needed.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a solo deck.  You will depend on teammates to maintain the board while you build up to the combo turn.\r\n\r\n## GAME PLAN:\r\n\r\n### [One Way or Another](/card/22015)\r\n\r\nWe recur this as much as we are comfortable to build up a big board of Side Schemes, while using the draw to get out [Overwatch](/card/30019), [Followed](/card/03032), [Sense of Justice](/card/14030), [Biokinetic Polymer Suit](/card/05009), & most importantly [Shrink](/card/05011)\r\n\r\n### [Even the Odds](/card/30014)\r\n\r\nand to a lesser extent [Multitasking](/card/15013) to soften up the side schemes.  Use [Passion for Justice](/card/34020) & [Shrink](/card/05011) to make big Thwarts.  Trigger a bunch of upgrades. \r\n\r\n### When to go off?\r\n\r\nI'd wait for 3 side schemes and to have [Followed](/card/03032) and [Overwatch](/card/30019) on all three.  You will trigger for 3 x 4 damage ([Followed](/card/03032)) and 3 damage ([Even the Odds](/card/30014)).  Overwatch is variable but these will help you get the Main Scheme down if you had any issues due to Patrol or Crisis Icons.  You can certainly go off with more than 3 but, I would want to keep Side Schemes in for rebuilding to do it again.\r\n\r\nRULES NOTE: Sadly [Embiggen!](/card/05010) doesn't work with [Even the Odds](/card/30014).\r\n\r\n### Allies\r\n\r\n[Wasp](/card/29034) is the the mainly there because of Crisis Icons that are likely to be on Side Schemes.  [Jessica Jones](/card/01059) is there to keep the main under control with buffs from the side schemes we're leaving out. [Quake](/card/08012) is cheap and an <span class=\"icon-energy\"></span>.  [Quasar](/card/21047) can help you set-up for the big turn.\r\n\r\n### FLEXIBLE SPOTS:\r\n\r\n[One Way or Another](/card/22015) #3 - With [Ms. Marvel](/card/05001a) being above to recur the event, you should only ever need one.  However, you want to get the 1st as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n### ALTERNATE CONSIDERATIONS:\r\n\r\n[Spider-Man](/card/04045) - We aren't looking to clear side schemes early but there are some scenarios with huge side schemes where I'd consider him.
